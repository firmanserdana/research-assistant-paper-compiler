### Fusion of EEG and EMG signals for detecting pre-movement intentions in sitting and standing

**Authors:** [Not provided in search results]

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2025.1532099

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EEG-EMG fusion, functional connectivity, motor intention detection, spinal cord injury, rehabilitation

**Summary:** This study proposes a novel multimodal fusion method based on EEG-EMG functional connectivity to detect sitting and standing intentions before movement execution[1]. The method achieved high accuracy (94.33% for healthy subjects, 87.54% for SCI patients) in classifying pre-movement intentions, outperforming single-modality approaches and maintaining robustness under fatigue conditions[1]. By enabling early and accurate detection of motor intentions, this approach has the potential to significantly improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of rehabilitation devices and neuroprostheses for individuals with movement disorders[1].

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** Finger kinematics, Wrist kinematics, Cortical decoding, Neuroprosthetics, Multi-fingered prosthetic hand

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the ability to decode individual finger and wrist kinematics from cortical neural activity for controlling an upper-limb neuroprosthesis.
