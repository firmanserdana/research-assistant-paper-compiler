**Summary:** I apologize, but I do not have enough information from the search results to provide a technical summary of the specific paper you mentioned. The search results do not contain details about a paper with that exact title, authors, or DOI. Without access to the actual paper or more specific information about its contents, I cannot accurately summarize its key innovation or potential impact for biorobotics research. If you have additional details about this paper, I'd be happy to try summarizing based on that information. ---
