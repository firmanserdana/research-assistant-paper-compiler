### Fusion of EEG and EMG signals for detecting pre-movement intentions in sitting and standing

**Authors:** Not provided in the search results

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2025.1532099

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** EEG-EMG fusion, functional connectivity, motor intention detection, spinal cord injury, rehabilitation

**Summary:** This study proposes a novel multimodal fusion method that combines EEG and EMG signals using functional connectivity to detect sitting and standing intentions before movement execution[1][5]. The method achieves high accuracy (94.33% in healthy subjects, 87.54% in SCI patients) in classifying pre-movement intentions, outperforming single-modality approaches and maintaining robustness under fatigue conditions[1]. This innovation has significant potential to improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of rehabilitation devices by enabling earlier and more accurate detection of motor intentions in both healthy individuals and those with spinal cord injuries[1][5].

### Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles during attempted movements

**Authors:** Not provided in the search results

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00312.2021

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EMG, motor unit, decoding, neuroprosthetics, spinal cord injury

**Summary:** This study demonstrates the use of a wearable electrode array to record and decode motor unit firing rates from paralyzed muscles in a person with motor complete tetraplegia. Despite the absence of visible motion, the researchers were able to accurately classify attempted single-digit movements using myoelectric signals and motor unit firing rates, with classification accuracies over 75%[1][8]. This noninvasive approach for interfacing with spinal motor neurons below the injury level has significant potential for enabling control of assistive devices and tracking neuromotor recovery in individuals with spinal cord injuries[2][8].

### High-Density Electromyography Based Control of Robotic Devices: On the Execution of Dexterous Manipulation Tasks

**Authors:** Anany Dwivedi, Jaime Lara, Leo K. Cheng, Niranchan Paskaranandavadivel, Minas Liarokapis

**DOI:** Not provided in the search results

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** High-density EMG, dexterous manipulation, robotic control, machine learning, random forests

**Summary:** This paper presents a novel learning scheme that uses high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) sensors to decode dexterous in-hand manipulation motions based on myoelectric activations of forearm and hand muscles. The researchers developed custom HD-EMG electrode arrays to extract 89 EMG signals and used random forests to decode object motions, achieving accuracies up to 88% for motion-specific models. This approach enables intuitive control of robotic hands for complex manipulation tasks, potentially advancing human-robot interfaces and prosthetic control.

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (3 papers)

### Decoding and geometry of ten finger movements in human posterior parietal and motor cortex

**Authors:** Guan C; Aflalo T; Zhang CY; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/acbf9a

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** Brain-machine interfaces, Neuroprosthetics, Posterior parietal cortex, Motor cortex, Finger movements

**Summary:** This study demonstrated high-accuracy decoding of individual finger movements from neural signals in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and motor cortex (MC) of tetraplegic participants, achieving up to 92% online accuracy for brain-machine interface control of contralateral fingers[1][2]. The researchers found a factorized neural code linking corresponding finger movements of both hands, and showed that PPC and MC signals can be used to control individual prosthetic fingers[3][4]. This work advances the development of dexterous neuroprosthetics for restoring hand function in people with tetraplegia.

### Decoding Joint-Level Hand Movements With Intracortical Neural Signals in a Human Brain-Computer Interface

**Authors:** Hu X; Zhang J; Jiang N; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3352847

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** Brain-computer interfaces, Motor cortex, Hand kinematics, Neural decoding, Intracortical recordings

**Summary:** This study investigates the decoding of fine hand movements at the single-joint level using intracortical neural signals recorded from the motor cortex in a human brain-computer interface[6]. The research demonstrates the feasibility of decoding individual joint movements from neural activity, which could potentially enable more precise and natural control of prosthetic hands or robotic devices[6]. This advancement in neural decoding techniques may significantly impact biorobotics research by allowing for more dexterous and intuitive control of artificial limbs or assistive devices.

### The impact of task context on predicting finger movements in a brain-machine interface

**Authors:** Suresh AK; Goodman JM; Okorokova EV; et al.

**DOI:** 10.7554/eLife.82598

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** Brain-machine interfaces, Motor cortex, Finger movements, Neural decoding, Task context

**Summary:** This study investigated how changes in task context, such as adding spring resistance or altering wrist posture, affect the performance of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) for decoding finger movements in rhesus macaques[1][3]. The researchers found that while offline decoding accuracy decreased in new contexts, monkeys could quickly adapt during online BMI control, likely due to the preservation of underlying neural population structure[1][4]. This work provides insights into BMI robustness across varying task conditions, which is crucial for translating these technologies to real-world applications in assistive devices and neuroprosthetics.
