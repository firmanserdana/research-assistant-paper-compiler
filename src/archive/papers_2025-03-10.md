**Keywords:** somatosensory cortex, hand kinematics, neural decoding, brain-computer interface, non-human primates
**Summary:** This study demonstrates that hand kinematics and kinetics can be accurately decoded from neural activity in area 2 of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in non-human primates during both active and passive hand movements. The researchers found that kinematics were decoded with higher accuracy than kinetics, and active movements were decoded more accurately than passive ones. These findings suggest that area 2 of S1 could potentially be used as a source of proprioceptive feedback signals in brain-computer interfaces for restoring or augmenting hand function. ---
