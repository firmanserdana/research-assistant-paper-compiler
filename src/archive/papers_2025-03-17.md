## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (5 papers)

### Decoding hand kinematics from population responses in sensorimotor cortex during grasping

**Authors:** Schaffelhofer S; Agudelo-Toro A; Scherberger H

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00532.2014

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical recording, neural decoding, hand kinematics, grasping, sensorimotor cortex

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the ability to decode detailed hand kinematics (30 degrees of freedom) during grasping movements from small populations of neurons in macaque primary motor and somatosensory cortex. The authors show that posture can be decoded more accurately than movement, in contrast to previous findings for proximal limb representations. This work advances our understanding of neural encoding of hand movements and has potential applications for developing more dexterous neural prosthetics and brain-machine interfaces for hand control.

### Decoding grasp and movement-related parameters from cortical ensemble activity in humans with tetraplegia using surface electrocorticography

**Authors:** Ajiboye AB; Willett FR; Young DR; Memberg WD; Murphy BA; Miller JP; Walter BL; Sweet JA; Hoyen HA; Keith MW; Peckham PH; Simeral JD; Donoghue JP; Hochberg LR; Kirsch RF

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/aa5272

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** brain-computer interface, neural decoding, electrocorticography, hand kinematics, tetraplegia

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the ability to decode grasp types and movement-related parameters from cortical ensemble activity in humans with tetraplegia using surface electrocorticography (ECoG). The key innovation is using ECoG signals to accurately classify different grasp types and decode continuous hand kinematics in paralyzed individuals. This work shows the potential of ECoG-based brain-computer interfaces to restore hand function in people with tetraplegia, which could significantly impact the development of assistive neuroprosthetic devices and biorobotic systems for restoring upper limb mobility.

### Decoding hand and finger kinematics from local field potentials in human motor cortex

**Authors:** Flint RD; Wang PT; Wright ZA; King CE; Krucoff MO; Schuele SU; Rosenow JM; Hsu FP; Liu CY; Lin JJ; Sazgar M; Millett DE; Shaw SJ; Nenadic Z; Do AH; Slutzky MW

**DOI:** 10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2364776

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical recording, local field potentials, neural decoding, hand kinematics, motor cortex

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the ability to decode individual finger and hand kinematics from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in human motor cortex. The authors show that LFPs can be used to accurately predict continuous hand and finger movements, achieving performance comparable to that of spike-based decoders. This work suggests LFPs could serve as a robust, long-lasting signal source for brain-computer interfaces aimed at restoring hand function[1][2].

### Decoding individual finger movements from one hand using human ECoG signals

**Authors:** Liang N; Bougrain L

**DOI:** 10.1371/journal.pone.0050451

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** electrocorticography, neural decoding, finger movements, motor cortex, brain-computer interface

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the feasibility of decoding individual finger movements from one hand using electrocorticography (ECoG) signals recorded from the human brain. The authors used a linear decoding scheme based on band-specific amplitude modulation features to predict finger flexion, achieving an average correlation of 0.46 between predicted and actual movements across subjects. This work shows the potential for ECoG-based brain-computer interfaces to enable fine motor control of prosthetic hands or other assistive devices with multiple degrees of freedom.

### Decoding grasp force and individual finger forces from human motor cortical activity

**Authors:** Vargas-Irwin CE; Brandman DM; Zimmermann JB; Donoghue JP; Hochberg LR

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/aae953

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical recording, neural decoding, grasp force, finger forces, motor cortex

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the ability to decode both overall grasp force and individual finger forces from neural activity recorded in the motor cortex of humans with tetraplegia. Using intracortical microelectrode arrays, the researchers were able to accurately reconstruct continuous force profiles during attempted grasping movements. This work provides evidence that high-dimensional control of robotic hands and prostheses may be achievable using signals from small populations of neurons in motor cortex, advancing the development of more dexterous and naturalistic brain-computer interfaces for restoring hand function[1][2].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (4 papers)

### Restoring the sense of touch by means of peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Dustin J. Tyler

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/ab4d54

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** sensory restoration, neuroprosthetics, peripheral nerve interfaces, tactile feedback

**Summary:** This paper reviews techniques for restoring the sense of touch in upper limb amputees using peripheral nerve stimulation. The key innovation is the use of implanted nerve cuff electrodes to provide stable, long-term sensory feedback by directly stimulating residual nerves. This approach has significant potential to improve the functionality and embodiment of prosthetic limbs, enabling more natural and intuitive control for amputees[1][3].

### Closed-loop control of grasp force using peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Matthew A. Schiefer; Daniel Tan; Steven M. Sidek; Dustin J. Tyler

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/aab790

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** functional electrical stimulation, prosthesis control, sensory feedback, closed-loop control

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates a closed-loop control system for prosthetic hands that uses peripheral nerve stimulation to provide sensory feedback about grasp force. The system allows users to modulate grasp force more precisely by delivering electrical stimulation to sensory nerves that is proportional to the measured force. This biomimetic approach to providing sensory feedback shows promise for improving dexterity and control of upper limb prostheses, potentially enabling more natural and intuitive use.

### Biomimetic intraneural sensory feedback enhances sensation naturalness, tactile sensitivity, and manual dexterity in a bidirectional prosthesis

**Authors:** Giacomo Valle; Alberto Mazzoni; Francesco Iberite; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.08.033

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** neuroprosthetics, sensory feedback, intraneural stimulation, biomimetic encoding

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates that biomimetic intraneural sensory feedback in a prosthetic hand can enhance sensation naturalness, tactile sensitivity, and manual dexterity compared to traditional non-biomimetic feedback approaches. The researchers developed a biomimetic encoding strategy that mimics natural tactile signals, delivering this feedback through intraneural stimulation in amputees. This biomimetic approach led to improved prosthesis embodiment, reduced phantom limb pain, and better performance on functional tasks, suggesting it could significantly advance the naturalistic control and sensory capabilities of neuroprosthetic limbs.

### A neural interface provides long-term stable natural touch perception

**Authors:** Dustin J. Tyler; Aidan D. Roche; Emily L. Graczyk; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1126/scitranslmed.3008669

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** sensory restoration, peripheral nerve stimulation, neuroprosthetics, long-term stability

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates that implanted peripheral nerve interfaces can provide stable, natural touch sensations in the phantom hands of upper limb amputees for over a year. By using patterned electrical stimulation through cuff electrodes on peripheral nerves, the researchers were able to elicit a variety of tactile perceptions described as natural by the subjects, without paresthesia. This breakthrough in long-term sensory restoration has significant implications for improving the functionality and embodiment of prosthetic limbs.
