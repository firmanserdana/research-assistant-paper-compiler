### Robust neural decoding for dexterous control of robotic hand prostheses
**Authors:** Liu S; Liu M; Zhang D; et al.
**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/adc48e
**TRL:** 4
**Keywords:** Neural decoding, Robotic hand, Finger kinematics, Prosthetics
**Summary:** This paper presents a novel neural decoding approach that uses high-density electromyogram signals to predict finger-specific neural drive signals for continuous control of individual fingers in a robotic prosthetic hand[8]. The developed decoder demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional methods, enabling more dexterous and natural control of prosthetic hands[8]. This innovation has the potential to significantly improve the functionality and usability of upper limb prostheses for individuals with hand disabilities. ---
