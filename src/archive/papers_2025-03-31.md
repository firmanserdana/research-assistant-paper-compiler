## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### A direct spinal cordâ€“computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand through brain-derived muscle activity

**Authors:** Daniela Souza Oliveira; Thomas Mehari Kinfe; Alessandro Del Vecchio

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awad311

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** Spinal cord injury, Electromyography, Motor unit decomposition, Brain-computer interface, Neuroprosthetics

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates a non-invasive neural interface that allows individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury to voluntarily control their paralyzed hand muscles by modulating spinal motor neuron activity[1][6]. The system decodes intended hand movements from high-density surface electromyography signals and maps them to a virtual hand, enabling proportional control of complex grasping motions despite years of paralysis[3][9]. This breakthrough has significant potential for restoring hand function in spinal cord injury patients through integration with assistive devices, representing an important advance for neuroprosthetics and biorobotics research.

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (3 papers)

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain-machine interface

**Authors:** Nason SR; Vaskov AK; Willsey MS; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41586-023-06094-5

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** Intracortical brain-machine interface, Finger kinematics, Neural decoding, Motor cortex

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the first successful continuous decoding of precise finger movements from primary motor cortex activity in rhesus macaques using intracortical brain-machine interfaces[1][4]. The researchers developed a novel behavioral task paradigm and used a standard Kalman filter to reconstruct finger movements with high accuracy, enabling real-time brain control of a virtual hand[1][4]. This breakthrough represents a significant step towards developing more dexterous neural prosthetic devices, potentially allowing individuals with severe motor disabilities to regain fine motor control of fingers and hands[1][4].

### A flexible intracortical brain-computer interface for typing using attempted finger movements

**Authors:** Willett FR; Avansino DT; Hochberg LR; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-023-39723-8

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** Brain-computer interface, Finger movements, Neural decoding, Typing

**Summary:** This paper presents a flexible intracortical brain-computer interface (BCI) for typing that decodes attempted finger movements, demonstrating high performance in both continuous "point-and-click" and discrete "keystroke" paradigms[1][4]. The system achieved typing speeds of 30-40 characters per minute with nearly 90% accuracy for point-and-click, and over 90% accuracy for 90 characters per minute in the keystroke paradigm[1][4]. This flexible BCI approach using finger movements could significantly advance assistive communication technologies for people with paralysis and inform future high-degree-of-freedom BCI designs[4].

### Robust neural decoding for dexterous control of robotic hand prostheses

**Authors:** Liu S; Liu M; Zhang D; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/adc48e

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** Neural decoding, Robotic hand, Finger kinematics, Prosthetics

**Summary:** This paper presents a novel neural decoding approach that uses high-density electromyogram signals to predict finger-specific neural drive signals for continuous control of individual fingers in a robotic prosthetic hand[8]. The developed decoder demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional methods, enabling more dexterous and natural control of prosthetic hands[8]. This innovation has the potential to significantly improve the functionality and usability of upper limb prostheses for individuals with hand disabilities.
