**Summary:** The paper "MyoGestic: EMG interfacing framework for decoding multiple spared motor dimensions in neural lesions" introduces a novel, noninvasive neural interface system that combines a high-density EMG bracelet with a machine learning framework to decode motor intent in individuals with spinal cord injuries, strokes, or amputations. The system enables real-time control of multiple motor dimensions, such as virtual hands or wearable devices, within minutes of setup, leveraging tailored AI models and participant feedback for intuitive and adaptive control. This innovation holds significant potential for biorobotics, as it bridges neural rehabilitation and advanced prosthetic control, offering a customizable and efficient platform for restoring motor function.
