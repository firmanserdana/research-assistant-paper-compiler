### MyoGestic: EMG interfacing framework for decoding multiple spared motor dimensions in neural lesions

**Authors:** A. S. Kundu; S. M. S. Rehman; J. D. Simeral; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.bme.2025.104567

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, high-density EMG, myocontrol, real-time control, neural interface[1]

**Summary:** MyoGestic introduces a participant-centered, wireless high-density EMG framework that enables rapid, individualized machine learning adaptation to decode multiple spared motor dimensions in people with neural lesions, such as spinal cord injury, stroke, or amputation[3][4]. The key innovation is its flexible, real-time AI-powered system that allows users to intuitively control prosthetic devices or digital interfaces within minutes, bridging the gap between laboratory research and practical biorobotics applications by supporting collaborative, iterative development of myocontrol algorithms[3][4]. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance user agency and accelerate the deployment of intuitive neural interfaces in rehabilitation and assistive robotics[3][4].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### Decoding hand kinetics and kinematics using somatosensory cortex area 2 in active and passive movement

**Authors:** S. Gharbawie; M. A. Lebedev; M. A. Nicolelis

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120236

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, hand kinematics, somatosensory cortex, proprioception, brain-computer interface[1]

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates that neural activity in area 2 of the somatosensory cortex (S1) encodes detailed hand kinematic and kinetic information during both active and passive movements, enabling accurate decoding of hand trajectories, joint angles, forces, and moments using optimized state-based algorithms[1]. The key innovation lies in showing that somatosensory signals, not just motor cortex activity, can robustly inform brain-computer interfaces for hand control and proprioceptive feedback, highlighting significant potential for enhancing biorobotics and neuroprosthetic systems by leveraging sensory cortex signals to restore or augment hand function[1].

### State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble signals from motor cortex

**Authors:** V. Aggarwal; N. V. Thakor

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.01038.2011

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** state-based decoding, hand kinematics, finger kinematics, neuronal ensemble, motor cortex[5]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the development of a state-based decoding framework that combines local field potential (LFP)-based state detection with spike-based kinematic decoding to improve the prediction of hand and finger movements from motor cortex signals during reach-to-grasp tasks[1][2][5]. This hybrid approach significantly enhances decoding accuracy of complex, multi-joint kinematics compared to traditional spike-only methods, representing a critical advancement for brain-machine interfaces and the control of dexterous, multifingered neuroprosthetic devices in biorobotics research[1][2].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (3 papers)

### Sensory feedback by peripheral nerve stimulation improves task performance in individuals with upper limb loss

**Authors:** Raspopovic S; Capogrosso M; Petrini FM; Bonizzato M; Rigosa J; Di Pino G; Carpaneto J; Controzzi M; Boretius T; Fernandez E; Granata G; Oddo CM; Citi L; Ciancio AL; Cipriani C; Carrozza MC; Jensen W; Guglielmelli E; Stieglitz T; Rossini PM; Micera S

**DOI:** 10.1038/nn.3689

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** peripheral nerve stimulation, sensory feedback, prosthetic hand, cuff electrodes, hand control[1]

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that providing sensory feedback via implanted peripheral nerve cuff electrodes significantly improves object discrimination, manipulation, and embodiment in individuals with upper limb loss using myoelectric prostheses[1]. The key innovation is the use of multi-channel cuff electrodes to deliver real-time, physiologically relevant tactile feedback directly to residual nerves, enabling blindfolded prosthesis users to achieve task performance comparable to sighted operation[1]. This advance highlights the potential for closed-loop sensory-motor integration in biorobotics, paving the way for more intuitive and functional prosthetic limbs[1].

### Control of Prosthetic Hands via the Peripheral Nervous System

**Authors:** Raspopovic S; Petrini FM; Zelechowski M; Valle G

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2016.00116

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** peripheral nervous system, prosthetic hand control, bidirectional interface, sensory feedback, TIME electrodes[5]

**Summary:** The paper presents a critical review and experimental validation of prosthetic hand control systems interfacing directly with the peripheral nervous system (PNS), highlighting the use of bidirectional interfaces—specifically, Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrodes (TIME)—to enable both myoelectric-driven motor control and real-time sensory feedback in amputees[1][2]. The key innovation lies in the closed-loop system that restores tactile sensation by stimulating peripheral nerves based on sensor data from the prosthetic hand, significantly enhancing the naturalness and functionality of prosthetic control. This approach represents a major advance for biorobotics, offering a pathway to more intuitive, lifelike prosthetic devices that can improve user experience and dexterity[1][2].

### Wireless Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for The Upper Limb: A Case Series

**Authors:** Goudman L; De Smedt A; Eldabe S; Moens M

**DOI:** 10.3390/ijerph20054488

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** wireless peripheral nerve stimulation, upper limb, hand control, neuromodulation, case study[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces wireless peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) as a novel approach for upper limb neuromodulation, specifically comparing device implantation in the upper arm versus the forearm for treating neuropathic pain and functional deficits[1][2][4]. The key innovation lies in demonstrating that upper arm placement of wireless PNS devices offers superior outcomes—such as reduced complications and improved stability—over forearm placement, which has direct implications for enhancing hand control and reliability in biorobotics and neuroprosthetic applications[1][4]. This advancement could significantly impact biorobotics by informing optimal electrode placement strategies for more effective, minimally invasive neural interfaces in upper limb assistive technologies.
