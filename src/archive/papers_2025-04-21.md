### Wireless Peripheral Nerve Stimulation for The Upper Limb: A Case Series
**Authors:** Goudman L; De Smedt A; Eldabe S; Moens M
**DOI:** 10.3390/ijerph
**TRL:** 5
**Keywords:** wireless peripheral nerve stimulation, upper limb, hand control, neuromodulation, case study[3]
**Summary:** The paper introduces wireless peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) as a novel approach for upper limb neuromodulation, specifically comparing device implantation in the upper arm versus the forearm for treating neuropathic pain and functional deficits[1][2][4]. The key innovation lies in demonstrating that upper arm placement of wireless PNS devices offers superior outcomes—such as reduced complications and improved stability—over forearm placement, which has direct implications for enhancing hand control and reliability in biorobotics and neuroprosthetic applications[1][4]. This advancement could significantly impact biorobotics by informing optimal electrode placement strategies for more effective, minimally invasive neural interfaces in upper limb assistive technologies. ---
