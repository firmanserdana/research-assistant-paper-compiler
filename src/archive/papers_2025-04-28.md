### MyoGestic: EMG interfacing framework for decoding multiple spared motor dimensions after neural lesions
**Authors:** Y. Zhang; S. S. Raspopovic; et al.
**DOI:** 10.1101/2024.04.09.
**TRL:** 5
**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, high-density EMG, myocontrol, neural interface[1][5]
**Summary:** MyoGestic introduces a wireless, high-density EMG bracelet and adaptive software framework that rapidly decodes multiple spared motor dimensions in individuals with neural lesions using advanced machine learning, enabling real-time, intuitive control of prosthetic devices or digital interfaces[1][4][5]. The key innovation lies in its participant-centered, customizable approach, which allows for collaborative algorithm development tailored to individual users’ residual motor signals, significantly advancing the potential for practical, user-adaptable neural interfaces in biorobotics and rehabilitation research[2][3][4]. --- ## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (3 papers)
