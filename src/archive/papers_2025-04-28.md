## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (3 papers)

### Decoding hand kinetics and kinematics using somatosensory cortex in active and passive movement

**Authors:** Mohammad A. Khatoun; Yuxiao Sun; Shreya Saxena

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120314

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, hand kinematics, somatosensory cortex, brain-computer interface, neural decoding[2]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a protocol for decoding both kinematic and kinetic parameters of hand movement from neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortex during both active and passive movements, using state-based and conventional decoding models[1][2]. The key innovation lies in leveraging a state-based approach that classifies movement directions and applies regression models per state, which significantly improves decoding accuracy over traditional methods. This advancement enhances the potential for more precise and robust brain-computer interface (BCI) control, directly benefiting biorobotics by enabling more naturalistic and responsive prosthetic and robotic hand systems[1].

### A flexible intracortical brain-computer interface for typing using attempted finger movements

**Authors:** [Authors not specified in summary; see source for full list]

**DOI:** Not available

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical BCI, finger kinematics, typing, neural decoding, flexible interface[1]

**Summary:** This paper introduces a flexible intracortical brain-computer interface (BCI) that enables individuals with paralysis to type by decoding attempted flexion and extension movements of finger groups, supporting both "point-and-click" and "keystroke" typing paradigms[1][4]. The key innovation lies in its adaptable neural decoding approach, which allows high-speed, high-accuracy character selection (up to 90 cued characters per minute with over 90% accuracy), matching state-of-the-art BCI performance and enabling simultaneous multi-character selection[1]. This advancement significantly broadens the potential for intuitive, high-performance neural interfaces in biorobotics, addressing unmet user needs for flexible and accessible digital communication[1].

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain–machine interfaces

**Authors:** Z. Irwin; J. Thompson; C. C. Chestek

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/aa83d2

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical BMI, finger movement, neural decoding, rhesus macaques, kinematics[5]

**Summary:** The paper by Irwin, Thompson, and Chestek demonstrates a novel intracortical brain–machine interface (BMI) capable of continuously decoding precise finger movements from neural activity in rhesus macaques, moving beyond previous BMI work that primarily focused on whole-arm or gross hand movements[1][2]. The key innovation lies in their development of a behavioral paradigm and decoding approach that enables real-time, fine-grained control of individual finger kinematics, which represents a significant advance for the field of biorobotics by paving the way for dexterous, neurally controlled prosthetic hands[1]. This work has the potential to dramatically improve the functionality of robotic prostheses for individuals with severe motor disabilities by enabling more natural and precise hand movements[1].

### The Role of Electrical Stimulation in Peripheral Nerve Regeneration

**Authors:** Not specified (review article)

**DOI:** Not provided

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** electrical stimulation, peripheral nerve regeneration, hand function, motor recovery, clinical trial, nerve injury[2]

**Summary:** Electrical stimulation (ES) has emerged as a key innovation in peripheral nerve regeneration, with both animal and clinical studies demonstrating that post-surgical ES—particularly at 20 Hz—can accelerate axonal outgrowth, enhance end-organ reinnervation, and improve motor and sensory recovery beyond standard surgical repair alone[2][1][3]. Mechanistically, ES augments intrinsic molecular pathways via cyclic AMP signaling, upregulates neurotrophic factors, and promotes the expression of regeneration-associated genes, offering a promising adjunct for restoring hand function and motor control after nerve injury[2][1]. These findings have significant implications for biorobotics, as integrating ES protocols could enhance neural interface performance and rehabilitation strategies in neuroprosthetics and robotic-assisted recovery[2][3].

### Peripheral nerve stimulation for lower‐limb postoperative recovery: A systematic review and meta‐analysis

**Authors:** Not specified

**DOI:** 10.1002/pchj.794

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** peripheral nerve stimulation, postoperative recovery, functional improvement, neuromodulation, rehabilitation[4]

**Summary:** This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in enhancing lower-limb postoperative recovery, synthesizing evidence from randomized controlled trials[1][2][3]. The key innovation lies in demonstrating that PNS can significantly improve functional outcomes and rehabilitation following lower-limb surgery, highlighting its potential as a neuromodulation strategy to accelerate recovery. These findings have direct implications for biorobotics research, suggesting that integrating PNS with robotic rehabilitation devices could optimize motor function restoration and patient outcomes after surgery[1][2][3].
