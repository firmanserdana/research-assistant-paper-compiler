## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (3 papers)

### Decoding Kinematic Information From Primary Motor Cortex Using Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis

**Authors:** Wang X; Zhang Y; Zhang X; Wang Y; Zhang S

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2020.509364

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** kinematic decoding, primary motor cortex, deep canonical correlation analysis, neural signals, hand movement

**Summary:** Wang et al. introduce a novel decoding algorithm that leverages deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) to extract and maximize nonlinear correlations between neural activity in the primary motor cortex and hand kinematics[1][2][4]. By mapping neural ensemble activity and movement parameters into a shared representational space, their approach enables more effective and concise decoding of movement information compared to traditional linear methods, offering significant potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of brain-machine interfaces and biorobotics applications[1][2][4].

### The Representation of Finger Movement and Force in Human Motor and Premotor Cortices

**Authors:** Willett FR; Avansino DT; Hochberg LR; Henderson JM; Shenoy KV

**DOI:** 10.1523/ENEURO.0063-20.2020

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** finger movement, force decoding, electrocorticography, neural ensemble, deep learning

**Summary:** The paper presents a novel investigation into how finger movement kinematics and isometric force are distinctly represented in human motor and premotor cortices using high-density electrocorticography (ECoG). By applying advanced deep learning and a new neural ensemble metric called the neural vector angle (NVA), the authors decoded finger movement and force with high accuracy and revealed separate spatial cortical representations and smooth neural trajectories for each behavioral mode. This distinction in cortical encoding has significant implications for biorobotics, particularly in improving the design and control of grasp brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) by enabling more precise and mode-specific decoding of motor commands for prosthetic and robotic hand control.
