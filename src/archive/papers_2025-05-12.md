## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (4 papers)

### Decoding of unimanual and bimanual reach-and-grasp actions from electromyographic and inertial signals in individuals with cervical spinal cord injury

**Authors:** S. Ison; J. M. Carmena; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neucom.2024.04.015

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, reach-and-grasp, human-machine interface, inertial measurement unit[4]

**Summary:** This paper presents a novel approach to decode both unimanual and bimanual reach-and-grasp actions in individuals with cervical spinal cord injury using a combination of electromyographic (EMG) signals and inertial measurement units. The key innovation lies in the development of a classification system that can predict different types of hand movements (including complex bimanual tasks) before the actual movement execution occurs, potentially enabling more natural control of neuroprosthetic devices for patients with spinal cord injuries[3][5]. This research could significantly impact biorobotics by providing a pathway for individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries to regain functional hand control through advanced human-machine interfaces, improving their independence and quality of life[2][5].

### Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles during attempted movements in tetraplegia

**Authors:** N. A. Mrachacz-Kersting; J. L. Thomas; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00486.2021

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** EMG, motor unit decomposition, tetraplegia, wearable sensors, machine learning[2]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development of a wearable electrode array combined with machine learning algorithms to record and decode myoelectric signals and motor unit firing rates from paralyzed muscles in individuals with motor complete tetraplegia, even in the absence of visible movement[1][2]. This approach enables accurate, real-time classification of attempted single-digit movements, demonstrating the potential for intuitive control of assistive devices and advancing the integration of neural interfaces in biorobotics for people with severe paralysis[1][2].

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand

**Authors:** J. Wagner; N. Capogrosso; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awad320

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** spinal cord-computer interface, EMG, SCI, neuroprosthetics, hand control[1]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a non-invasive spinal cord–computer interface that decodes voluntary motor neuron activity from individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury, enabling real-time, proportional control of multiple hand movements through wearable muscle sensors[2][1]. This approach reveals that even after years of paralysis, spared spinal motor neurons can be harnessed for functional hand control, representing a significant advance for neuroprosthetics and offering new directions for biorobotics research in restoring complex motor functions after SCI[2][1].

### Use of Surface EMG in Clinical Rehabilitation of Individuals With SCI

**Authors:** A. S. D. Smith; J. L. Thomas; et al.

**DOI:** 10.3389/fneur.2020.578559

**TRL:** 2

**Keywords:** surface EMG, clinical rehabilitation, spinal cord injury, neurorehabilitation[3]

**Summary:** This paper examines the barriers preventing widespread clinical adoption of surface electromyography (sEMG) in spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation, highlighting challenges such as time constraints for clinicians, limited technical training, and SCI-specific interpretation difficulties[5]. The authors advocate for a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to overcome these obstacles, noting that while sEMG provides valuable quantifiable information on muscle activity that other assessment techniques cannot offer, its clinical implementation remains limited despite its extensive use in research settings[3][5]. This work could significantly impact biorobotics research by identifying the gaps between research applications and clinical practice, potentially informing the development of more user-friendly sEMG systems that could enhance rehabilitation technologies and robotic assistive devices for SCI patients.

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (1 papers)

### Intrafascicular peripheral nerve stimulation produces fine functional hand movements

**Authors:** Capogrosso M; Milekovic T; Borton D; Wagner F; Moraud EM; Mignardot JB; Buse N; Gandar J; Barraud Q; Xing D; Rey E; Duis S; Jianzhong Y; Ko WKD; Li Q; Detemple P; Denison T; Micera S; Bezard E; Bloch J; Courtine G

**DOI:** 10.1126/scitranslmed.abg1866

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intrafascicular electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, hand control, functional grasp, neuroprosthetics[3]

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that implanting just two intrafascicular electrodes into the peripheral nerves of nonhuman primates enables selective, reliable activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles, producing a diverse array of dexterous and functional hand movements, including multiple grip types and sustained force generation[1][3]. This approach achieves fine motor control with far fewer electrodes than conventional surface or intramuscular stimulation methods, highlighting a major innovation for neuroprosthetics and biorobotics by enabling more natural, functional hand restoration for individuals with paralysis or limb loss[1][3]. The findings suggest significant potential for clinical translation, offering a minimally invasive, high-precision interface for advanced robotic hand control systems[1].
