## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (4 papers)

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand by decoding the neural drive to muscles in humans with tetraplegia

**Authors:** Marco Capogrosso; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awad282

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** spinal cord injury, EMG decoding, neural interface, hand control, tetraplegia[1]

**Summary:** This paper introduces a direct spinal cord-computer interface that decodes neural signals from the spinal cord to control paralyzed hand movements in individuals with tetraplegia. The key innovation lies in the ability to interpret the neural drive to muscles directly from the spinal cord, bypassing the injury site and enabling restoration of hand function without requiring brain implants[1]. This technology represents a significant advancement in biorobotics research by providing a less invasive alternative to brain-computer interfaces, potentially offering a more practical pathway for clinical translation to help people with spinal cord injuries regain functional movement capabilities.

### Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles during attempted movements in a person with tetraplegia

**Authors:** Y. Chen; J. M. Mrachacz-Kersting; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00435.2021

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EMG, motor unit decoding, wearable sensors, spinal cord injury, machine learning[2]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a wearable electrode array combined with machine learning algorithms to record and decode myoelectric signals and motor unit firing in paralyzed muscles of a person with motor complete tetraplegia[1][2]. This approach enables accurate classification of attempted single-digit movements even without visible motion, demonstrating a significant advance for biorobotics by providing a non-invasive, task-specific neural interface that could allow individuals with severe paralysis to control assistive devices through their movement intentions[1][2].

### High-frequency epidural electrical stimulation reduces spasticity and pathologic muscle cocontraction after spinal cord injury

**Authors:** A. Formento; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1126/scitranslmed.adp9607

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** spinal cord injury, EMG, epidural electrical stimulation, spasticity, rehabilitation[5]

**Summary:** The paper by Formento et al. demonstrates that high-frequency epidural electrical stimulation (HF-EES) applied to the injured spinal cord can immediately reduce spasticity and pathologic muscle cocontraction in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury, when integrated into a rehabilitation program[4]. The key innovation lies in pairing HF-EES, which blocks aberrant dorsal root activity, with low-frequency EES to selectively enhance voluntary muscle activation, resulting in improved motor function. This approach offers a promising neuromodulation strategy for biorobotics, as it enables more precise and adaptive control of muscle activity, potentially improving the integration of assistive technologies with neurorehabilitation protocols[4].

### Noninvasive decoder could help restore movement after spinal cord injury

**Authors:** Ismael Seáñez; Carolyn Atkinson; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1186/s12984-025-01307-2

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** noninvasive decoder, spinal cord injury, EEG, EMG, brain-spine interface[3]

**Summary:** The paper by Seáñez, Atkinson, and colleagues introduces a noninvasive brain-spine interface that decodes movement intentions from EEG signals and uses these real-time predictions to trigger transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, thereby reinforcing voluntary movement in individuals with spinal cord injury[3][5]. The key innovation lies in the use of a noninvasive neural decoder to restore communication between the brain and spinal circuits, offering a promising, less invasive alternative for rehabilitation and paving the way for future biorobotics applications in restoring motor function after paralysis[3][5].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Not specified in search results

**DOI:** Not fully specified

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** graphene, cuff electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, self-folding films

**Summary:** This paper introduces a self-folding graphene-based thin-film electrode designed for peripheral nerve stimulation that can wrap around nerve fibers while minimizing damage[5]. The electrodes feature strategically patterned holes and slits that control folding direction and reduce impedance between graphene and electrolyte, with approximately 80% of films folding in the intended direction[5]. When tested on rat sciatic nerves, the electrodes successfully induced leg movement upon electrical stimulation, demonstrating their potential to enhance neural stimulation therapies by enabling more targeted stimulation of finer nerve fibers, which represents a significant advancement for biorobotics applications requiring precise neural interfaces[5][3].

### Mechanism of peripheral nerve modulation and recent applications

**Authors:** Not specified in search results

**DOI:** 10.1080/15599612.2021.1978601

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** peripheral neuromodulation, electrical stimulation, optogenetic approaches

**Summary:** This paper explores mechanisms of peripheral nerve modulation, comparing optogenetic stimulation and electrical stimulation techniques, with findings showing both approaches can effectively decrease heart rate during right vagus nerve stimulation[4]. The research examines peripheral neuromodulation methods, which represent alternatives to traditional electrical stimulation approaches used in applications like neuroprosthetics and pain management[1][2]. This work has significant implications for biorobotics research by potentially enabling more precise and artifact-free control of neural circuits in the peripheral nervous system, which could lead to improved neuroprosthetic applications and more sophisticated closed-loop systems for muscle activation and organ function modulation[1][5].
