## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles during attempted movements of a person with tetraplegia

**Authors:** M. A. Ganji; S. M. Muceli; D. Farina

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00525.2021

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, wearable electrode array, motor unit decomposition, assistive devices[2]

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates a wearable electrode array system that successfully records and decodes myoelectric signals and motor unit firing in paralyzed muscles of a person with motor complete tetraplegia[1][4]. The researchers showed that even without visible motion, the patterns of EMG and motor unit firing rates were highly task-specific, enabling accurate classification of attempted single-digit movements with classification accuracies exceeding 75%[4]. This innovation has significant potential for creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can detect movement intentions from spared motor neurons, potentially enabling individuals with severe tetraplegia to control assistive technologies such as computers, wheelchairs, and robotic manipulators[1][4].

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand

**Authors:** S. Barra; M. Sartori; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awad258

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** spinal cord–computer interface, EMG, spinal cord injury, hand control, neuroprosthetics[1]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development of a non-invasive spinal cord–computer interface that decodes voluntary neural activity from spared spinal motor neurons in individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury, enabling real-time, proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom in a virtual hand[2][3][5]. This breakthrough demonstrates that even years after paralysis, SCI patients retain functional neural pathways that can be harnessed for intuitive neuroprosthetic control, offering significant potential for advancing biorobotics and rehabilitation technologies[2][3][5].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (1 papers)

### Robust neural decoding for dexterous control of robotic hand using high-density electromyogram signals

**Authors:** Zhang X; Wang Y; Chen X; Zhu X; Wang Y; Li G

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.bspc.2023.104474

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** neural decoding, finger kinematics, robotic hand, high-density EMG, deep learning

**Summary:** This paper introduces a deep learning-based neural decoding approach that maps high-density electromyogram (HD-EMG) signals to finger-specific neural-drive signals for continuous, dexterous control of robotic hands[1]. The key innovation lies in the ability to consistently and accurately predict finger joint kinematics with lower prediction errors compared to conventional methods, while maintaining stability over time and robustness to EMG signal variations[1]. This neural-machine interface could significantly advance prosthetic technology by enabling more natural, multi-finger dexterous control of assistive robotic hands, potentially improving quality of life for individuals with neuromuscular injuries or hand loss[1][2].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### The Next Frontier in Neuroprosthetics: Integration of Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback

**Authors:** S. S. Lee; J. M. Svientek; K. A. Cederna; P. S. Cederna

**DOI:** 10.3390/bioengineering12020124

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** biomimetic neurostimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, somatosensory feedback, neuroprosthetics, hand prosthesis[3]

**Summary:** The paper reviews recent advances in integrating biomimetic somatosensory feedback into neuroprosthetic limbs, highlighting the use of in-silicon neuron models and advanced neural interfaces to deliver tactile sensations that closely mimic natural touch[2]. The key innovation is the development of neurostimulation paradigms that replicate biological sensory coding, resulting in more natural and intuitive feedback for prosthesis users, which significantly enhances functional performance and user experience[2][4]. This approach represents a major step forward for biorobotics, as it enables more seamless human-machine integration and paves the way for neuroprosthetic devices that can restore lifelike sensory experiences[2][4].

### Neuromodulation of the peripheral nervous system: Bioelectronic medicine approaches and clinical applications

**Authors:** S. R. Patel; J. S. Kwon; M. S. Humayun

**DOI:** 10.1002/bmm2.12048

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** neuromodulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, bioelectronic medicine, hand control, robotics[5]

**Summary:** The paper by Patel, Kwon, and Humayun reviews recent advances in neuromodulation of the peripheral nervous system using bioelectronic medicine, highlighting innovative flexible neural interfaces that can precisely stimulate small, deep peripheral nerves without causing damage[5]. The key innovation is the development of conformable, minimally invasive devices—such as flexible neural clips—that enable targeted modulation of nerve activity, offering fine control over physiological functions like hand movement. This technology has significant potential for biorobotics research, particularly in enhancing robotic hand control and creating more intuitive, responsive neuroprosthetic systems[5].
