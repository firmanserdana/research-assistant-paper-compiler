## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### Brain decoder controls spinal cord stimulation

**Authors:** Ismael Seáñez, Carolyn Atkinson, et al.

**DOI:** Not provided in search results

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** Brain wave decoder, EEG, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, rehabilitation

**Summary:** The paper presents a novel noninvasive brain-spine interface that uses EEG-based brain wave decoding to predict movement intentions and trigger transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, enabling voluntary movement reinforcement in a single joint[1][2][5]. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of real-time, closed-loop control of spinal circuits using only neural signals, which could be adapted for biorobotics to create more intuitive brain-machine interfaces for rehabilitation or assistive robotics. The technology’s potential lies in its ability to generalize across users, simplifying integration into clinical and robotic applications for restoring movement after neurological injury[1][3].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (1 papers)

### Protocol for state-based decoding of hand movement parameters from primary somatosensory cortex

**Authors:** Not specified in search results

**DOI:** Not specified in search results

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** State-based decoding, hand movement, primary somatosensory cortex, kinematic parameters, kinetic parameters

**Summary:** The paper introduces a protocol for decoding both kinematic and kinetic hand movement parameters from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) using a state-based approach, which classifies movement directions into discrete states and applies regression models tailored to each state[2][3]. This state-based decoding method significantly outperforms conventional decoders, particularly for active movements, improving the accuracy of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems and offering enhanced potential for providing proprioceptive feedback in biorobotics applications[2][3]. The protocol's ability to accurately extract detailed movement information from S1 advances the development of more intuitive and responsive neuroprosthetic devices[3].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (1 papers)

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Not specified in search results

**DOI:** Not specified in search results

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** graphene, thin-film electrode, self-folding films, peripheral nerve stimulation

**Summary:** This paper introduces a novel self-folding graphene-based thin-film electrode designed for peripheral nerve stimulation. The electrodes are patterned with holes and slits to control folding direction, allowing them to wrap around nerve fibers while maintaining electrical conductivity, which enhances their versatility in targeting finer nerve fibers. This innovation holds significant potential for biorobotics research by improving neural interfaces, enabling more precise and less invasive stimulation techniques for drug-resistant neurological disorders.
