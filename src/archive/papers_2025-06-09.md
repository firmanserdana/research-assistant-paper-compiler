## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand

**Authors:** Marco Capogrosso; Jocelyne Bloch; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awae247

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, neural interface, hand function, rehabilitation[1]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the development of a non-invasive spinal cord–computer interface that enables individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury to voluntarily control motor units in their paralyzed hands, as detected via high-density surface electromyography[1]. By decoding these residual neural signals, the system allows real-time proportional control of multiple hand movements, demonstrating the potential to restore complex hand function and providing a promising platform for integration with assistive devices in biorobotics and neurorehabilitation[1].

### Interfacing With Alpha Motor Neurons in Spinal Cord Injury Patients: A Perspective on Decoding Strategies

**Authors:** Silvia Muceli; Dario Farina

**DOI:** 10.3389/fneur.2020.00493

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, alpha motor neurons, spinal cord injury, closed-loop control, HD-EMG[5]

**Summary:** This paper explores a non-invasive neural interface technology that enables direct communication with alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The innovation lies in decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles by analyzing motor unit action potentials (MUAPs), which provide direct indication of alpha motor neuron output[3]. This approach has significant potential for biorobotics research by enabling closed-loop control systems that could restore movement function in SCI patients through computer interfaces that interpret remaining motor neuron activity[2][5].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (1 papers)

### Robust neural decoding for dexterous control of robotic hand using high-density electromyogram

**Authors:** Zhang X; Li S; Zhou P

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120175

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** Neural decoding, finger kinematics, HD-EMG, robotic hand, deep learning, prosthetics[5]

**Summary:** Zhang, Li, and Zhou present a robust neural decoding framework that leverages high-density electromyogram (HD-EMG) signals and deep learning to accurately infer finger kinematics for dexterous robotic hand control[5]. The key innovation lies in their use of HD-EMG combined with advanced neural decoding algorithms, enabling precise and reliable multi-finger movement decoding, which addresses longstanding challenges in prosthetic and biorobotic hand manipulation. This approach has significant potential to enhance the functionality and intuitiveness of next-generation prosthetic devices and robotic hands in biorobotics research[5].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### Surgically Implanted Electrodes Enable Real-Time Finger and Grasp Pattern Recognition for Prosthetic Hands

**Authors:** [Not specified in search result; typically available in full article]

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.bjps.2023.03.014

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** finger and grasp control, intramuscular electrodes, myoelectric prostheses, peripheral nerve interfaces[5]

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates that surgically implanted electrodes can record high-quality, finger-specific electromyography (EMG) signals, enabling reliable and intuitive control of upper limb prostheses with impressive accuracy (up to 97.9%) and low latency (as little as 135 ms)[1]. The research shows that pattern recognition systems can effectively utilize EMG signals from intramuscular electrodes and Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNIs) to provide users with fast and accurate grasp control, representing a significant advancement over traditional surface EMG approaches that often result in cumbersome or unreliable prosthetic control[1][3]. This innovation addresses a critical barrier in prosthetic rehabilitation by providing high-fidelity control signals that allow for more natural and intuitive control of robotic hands, potentially reducing device abandonment rates and improving quality of life for individuals with upper limb amputations[1

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** [Not specified in search result; typically available in full article]

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0188021

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** graphene electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, self-folding, thin-film electrodes, neural interface[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a self-folding graphene-based thin-film electrode designed for peripheral nerve stimulation, featuring patterned holes and slits that enable the film to autonomously wrap around fine nerve fibers and reduce electrode impedance. This innovation allows precise targeting and stimulation of smaller nerves, as demonstrated by successful motor neuron activation in rat sciatic nerves, and holds significant promise for advancing minimally invasive neural interfaces in biorobotics and neuroprosthetic applications[1][3][5].
