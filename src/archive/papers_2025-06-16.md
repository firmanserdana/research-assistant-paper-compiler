## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand by decoding motor intentions from the spinal cord in humans

**Authors:** Marco Capogrosso; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awae251

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** spinal cord–computer interface, EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, motor intention, hand control[1]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a direct spinal cord–computer interface that decodes motor intentions from the spinal cord itself, enabling volitional control of a paralyzed hand in humans with spinal cord injury. This key innovation bypasses the damaged neural pathways by extracting residual motor signals from the spinal cord, rather than the brain, to control hand movements, offering a novel approach distinct from traditional brain-computer interfaces. The technology has significant potential for biorobotics research by providing a new avenue for restoring fine motor control in paralysis, expanding the toolkit for neuroprosthetic and assistive device development[1][2][3].

### Interfacing With Alpha Motor Neurons in Spinal Cord Injury Patients: A Perspective on Decoding Strategies

**Authors:** S. Negro; D. Farina

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2020.00489

**TRL:** 2

**Keywords:** alpha motor neurons, spinal cord injury, EMG decoding, non-invasive interface, closed-loop control[5]

**Summary:** The paper proposes a non-invasive method for decoding the behavior of individual alpha motor neurons (α-MNs) in spinal cord injury patients, leveraging advanced electromyographic (EMG) signal processing to enable real-time, closed-loop control of assistive devices[1][5]. This approach could significantly advance biorobotics research by providing a direct, high-resolution interface to the neural drive of paralyzed muscles, facilitating more natural and responsive movement restoration in robotic prosthetics and exoskeletons[1][4].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### Robust neural decoding for dexterous control of robotic hand using high-density electromyogram signals

**Authors:** Zhang X; Chen X; Li Y; Zhu X; Zhang D

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.bbe.2023.06.002

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** Neural decoding, finger kinematics, HD-EMG, prosthetic hand, deep learning, joint angle prediction[4]

**Summary:** Zhang et al. present a robust neural decoding approach leveraging high-density electromyogram (HD-EMG) signals and deep learning to accurately and continuously predict finger-specific motoneuron firing frequencies for real-time, dexterous control of a robotic hand[1][2]. The key innovation is the neural-drive decoder, which achieves significantly lower joint angle prediction errors and superior finger separation compared to conventional EMG-based methods, enabling stable and precise multi-finger control even under signal variability[1]. This advancement offers a novel neural-machine interface with strong potential to enhance the dexterity and usability of prosthetic and assistive robotic hands in biorobotics research[1].

### Cortical decoding of individual finger and wrist kinematics for an entire hand

**Authors:** Wang W; Chan SS; Heldman DA; Moran DW

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00520.2009

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** Cortical decoding, finger kinematics, wrist kinematics, prosthetic hand, single unit activity[5]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the demonstration that single-unit activity recorded from the primary motor cortex can be used to accurately decode the kinematics of individual fingers and the wrist simultaneously, enabling real-time prediction of fine hand movements[1]. By employing both linear and nonlinear decoding algorithms, including artificial neural networks and Kalman filters, the study achieved high accuracy in reconstructing the movements of each digit and the wrist, paving the way for advanced neural control of multi-fingered prosthetic hands and significantly advancing the field of biorobotics[1]. This approach enables more dexterous and naturalistic prosthetic hand control, addressing a major challenge in neuroprosthetics research[1].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Y. Wang; J. Kim; S. Lee; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0182349

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** graphene electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, thin-film devices, neural interfaces, biomedical robotics[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a self-folding graphene-based thin-film electrode designed for peripheral nerve stimulation, featuring patterned holes and slits that enable the device to autonomously wrap around fine nerve fibers while reducing electrode impedance[1][2][5]. This innovation allows for minimally invasive, targeted stimulation of small nerves, demonstrated by successful motor neuron activation in rat sciatic nerves, and holds significant promise for advancing precise neural interfaces in biomedical robotics and neural prosthetics[1][2][5].

### Neurorobotics for neurorehabilitation

**Authors:** J.A. George; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1126/science.abj5259

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** neurorobotics, neurorehabilitation, biomimetic sensory feedback, peripheral nerve stimulation, bionic hand[4]

**Summary:** The paper by George et al. introduces a human-machine interface that translates prosthetic sensor data into biomimetic sensory feedback, enabling direct communication with the peripheral nervous system to restore naturalistic sensations in neuroprosthetic users[1][4]. This innovation not only enhances functional embodiment and reduces cognitive load during prosthesis use but also holds promise for inducing beneficial neuroplastic changes in the central nervous system, representing a significant advance in biorobotics and neurorehabilitation research[1][4]. The approach paves the way for more lifelike, intuitive bionic limbs that could eventually replicate the full spectrum of natural touch, profoundly impacting the field of neurorobotics[4].
