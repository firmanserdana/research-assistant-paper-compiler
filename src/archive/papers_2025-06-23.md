## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### Interfacing With Alpha Motor Neurons in Spinal Cord Injury Patients: Decoding and Frequency-Domain Analysis of Individual α-MNs Spike Trains

**Authors:** Negro F.; Muceli S.; Castronovo A.M.; Holobar A.; Farina D.

**DOI:** 10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2995631

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, alpha motor neurons, non-invasive, closed-loop control, spike train decomposition[4]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a novel non-invasive methodology for decoding and analyzing individual alpha motor neuron (α-MN) spike trains in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, leveraging advanced EMG decomposition and frequency-domain analysis to directly assess α-MN behavior in vivo[1][4]. This approach enables real-time, closed-loop modulation of spinal cord excitability by optimizing electrical stimulation parameters based on direct neural feedback, potentially transforming personalized neurorehabilitation and advancing biorobotics by providing a precise neural interface for controlling assistive devices[1][3]. The key innovation lies in the ability to non-invasively monitor and modulate individual α-MNs, paving the way for adaptive, model-based control strategies in rehabilitation and biorobotic applications[1].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (3 papers)

### Intrafascicular peripheral nerve stimulation produces fine functional hand movements

**Authors:** Capogrosso M; Milekovic T; Borton D; Wagner F; Moraud EM; Mignardot JB; Buse N; Gandar J; Barraud Q; Xing D; Rey E; Duis S; Jianzhong Y; Ko WKD; Li Q; Detemple P; Denison T; Micera S; Bezard E; Bloch J; Courtine G

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuron.2021.09.027

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intrafascicular electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, hand control, functional grasp, neuroprosthetics[4]

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that just two intrafascicular electrodes implanted in the median and radial nerves can selectively and reliably activate both extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles, enabling a wide range of dexterous, functional hand movements and sustained grasp forces in primates[1][2]. This approach achieves fine motor control with far fewer electrodes than traditional surface or intramuscular stimulation methods, significantly advancing the potential for clinically viable neuroprosthetic systems and offering a promising avenue for restoring hand function in individuals with paralysis—an innovation with substantial implications for biorobotics and neuroprosthetic device design[1][2].

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Wang Y; Li J; Zhang Y; Wang Y; Li J; Zhang Y; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0186920

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** graphene electrodes, cuff electrode, peripheral nerve stimulation, flexible electronics, neural interface[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a self-folding graphene-based thin-film cuff electrode designed for peripheral nerve stimulation, utilizing micro-patterned holes and slits to precisely control the folding direction and ensure efficient nerve contact[1][5]. This innovation enables the fabrication of ultra-thin, biocompatible electrodes that can wrap around small-diameter nerves, broadening the applicability of neural interfaces for advanced biorobotics and neuroprosthetic systems[1]. The controllable self-folding mechanism and the use of multilayer graphene suggest significant potential for multifunctional, minimally invasive bioelectronic devices in biorobotics research[1].

### Peripheral neurostimulation for encoding artificial somatosensations

**Authors:** Oddo CM

**DOI:** 10.1111/ejn.15822

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** peripheral nerve stimulation, artificial somatosensation, neuroprosthetics, sensory feedback, hand prosthesis[5]

**Summary:** The paper by Oddo CM presents advances in peripheral nerve stimulation techniques for encoding artificial somatosensations, focusing on how precise modulation of stimulation parameters (such as pulse width, amplitude, and frequency) can generate tailored tactile feedback in neuroprosthetic devices[1]. The key innovation lies in real-time, personalized sensory encoding strategies that enable more natural and functional sensory feedback for users of hand prostheses, significantly enhancing prosthetic control and user experience[1][5]. This work has substantial implications for biorobotics, as it paves the way for more intuitive and effective integration of artificial sensory feedback in robotic limbs, improving the quality of life for individuals with sensorimotor disabilities[1].
