## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### Interfacing With Alpha Motor Neurons in Spinal Cord Injury Patients: Decoding and Modulation of Spinal Cord Output

**Authors:** M. Negro; D. Farina

**DOI:** 10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2995276

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, alpha motor neurons, non-invasive, closed-loop control, tsDCS[5]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **non-invasive method to decode and modulate the activity of spinal alpha motor neurons in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients** by leveraging advanced EMG signal processing and transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS)[1][3]. This approach enables **real-time, closed-loop control of spinal cord output**, offering a direct interface with the neural drive to muscles, which holds significant promise for optimizing rehabilitation strategies and developing more effective biorobotic assistive devices for individuals with SCI[1][3]. The key innovation lies in the ability to estimate and modulate individual alpha motor neuron behavior non-invasively, paving the way for personalized, adaptive neurorehabilitation and next-generation neural interfaces in biorobotics[1][3].

### Brain decoder controls spinal cord stimulation to reinforce voluntary movement after spinal cord injury

**Authors:** J. Seáñez; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41591-024-02910-3

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** brain-spine interface, EMG decoding, spinal cord stimulation, noninvasive, rehabilitation[2]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development of a **noninvasive brain-spine interface** that uses real-time EEG-based brain decoding to trigger **transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation**, thereby reinforcing voluntary movement in individuals with spinal cord injury[1][3]. By demonstrating that movement intentions—detected even during imagined movement—can reliably control spinal stimulation, this approach enables closed-loop rehabilitation strategies that could significantly advance **biorobotics** by integrating neural decoding with neuromodulation to restore motor function after paralysis[1][3].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### Decoding of Finger, Hand and Arm Kinematics Using Switching Linear Dynamical Systems

**Authors:** Aggarwal V; Acharya S; Tenore F; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1109/TBME.2013.2284890

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger kinematics, hand kinematics, switching linear dynamical systems, brain–machine interface[2]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **switching linear dynamical systems (S-LDS) framework** for decoding finger, hand, and arm kinematics from intracortical neural signals, offering a significant advance over traditional single Kalman filter approaches by modeling motion as a sequence of discrete states, each with its own linear dynamics[3][4]. The key innovation is leveraging the observability of both discrete and continuous states during training, which simplifies inference and enables **motion-state-dependent adaptive decoding** with higher accuracy, making it highly promising for real-time brain–machine interfaces and adaptive control in biorobotics and prosthetic devices[3][4].

### Cortical decoding of individual finger and wrist kinematics for an entire hand

**Authors:** Vargas-Irwin CE; Shakhnarovich G; Yadollahpour P; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2039590

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** cortical decoding, finger kinematics, wrist kinematics, neural prosthetics, multi-fingered prosthetic hand[4]

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **neural activity from the primary motor cortex can be used to simultaneously decode the kinematics of individual fingers and the wrist**, enabling the prediction of complex, multi-joint hand movements in real time[1]. The key innovation is the successful application of both linear and nonlinear decoding algorithms to extract detailed finger and wrist trajectories, laying the groundwork for **dexterous, multi-fingered prosthetic hand control** in neural prosthetics and biorobotics[1]. This advance significantly enhances the potential for developing prosthetic devices that restore fine motor skills and naturalistic hand function to users[1].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### Surgically Implanted Electrodes Enable Real-Time Finger and Grasp Pattern Recognition for Prosthetic Hands

**Authors:** Alexander K. Vaskov; Philip P. Vu; Paul S. Irwin; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2022.109678

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** finger and grasp control, intramuscular electrodes, myoelectric prostheses, peripheral nerve interfaces, pattern recognition

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the use of **surgically implanted intramuscular electrodes and regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (RPNIs)** to record high-fidelity electromyographic signals, enabling real-time, intuitive pattern recognition of individual finger and grasp movements for prosthetic hand control[3][5]. In trials with transradial amputees, this approach achieved rapid and accurate selection of up to ten finger and wrist postures (94.7% success, 255 ms latency), with even higher performance for grasp patterns, demonstrating robust, position-independent control. This technology represents a significant advance for biorobotics, offering a pathway to more natural, dexterous prosthetic hand function by directly interfacing with the neuromuscular system[3].

### Intrafascicular peripheral nerve stimulation produces fine functional hand movements in primates

**Authors:** Quentin Barraud; David Guiraud; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.brs.2021.10.015

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intrafascicular electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, hand control, functional grasp, primates, neuroprosthetics

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the use of **intrafascicular peripheral electrodes** to selectively stimulate motor fibers in the median and radial nerves, enabling **precise and functional hand movements—including multiple grip types and sustained forces—in primates**[4]. Remarkably, just two implanted electrodes were sufficient to generate a diverse range of dexterous hand actions, demonstrating a scalable and clinically relevant approach for restoring hand function, which holds significant promise for advancing **biorobotic neuroprosthetics** and the development of more effective assistive technologies for paralysis[4].
