## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles after spinal cord injury

**Authors:** JE Ting; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1126/scitranslmed.abg3841

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** surface EMG, neural drive, spinal cord injury, motor unit decomposition, assistive devices[4]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **wearable, non-invasive neural interface** that uses high-density surface EMG and advanced motor unit decomposition to sense and decode the **neural drive to paralyzed muscles** in individuals with spinal cord injury, even when no overt movement is present[3][1]. This innovation enables the extraction of volitional motor unit activity below the injury level, providing a **direct and precise neural control signal** for assistive devices and biorobotic systems, with significant implications for restoring movement and enhancing neuroprosthetic control in paralyzed populations[3][1].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (1 papers)

### Decoding the brain-machine interaction for upper limb assistive technologies: A review

**Authors:** Mondini A; Kobler RJ; Ofner P; Müller-Putz GR

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnbot.2024.1183967

**TRL:** 2

**Keywords:** intracortical microelectrode, hand kinematics, upper limb, assistive robotics, neural correlates, brain-machine interface[3]

**Summary:** This review synthesizes recent advances in decoding neural activity for upper limb assistive technologies, emphasizing the integration of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that translate preparatory brain signals—such as readiness potentials and sensorimotor rhythms—into precise control commands for robotic arms and neuroprosthetics[1][3][4]. The key innovation lies in leveraging continuous decoding of movement trajectories from EEG and other physiological signals to improve the reliability and adaptability of assistive devices, which holds significant potential to enhance neurorehabilitation outcomes and drive progress in biorobotics research by enabling more natural and effective user-device interaction[1][3][4].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (1 papers)

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Yusuke Miyamoto; Shingo Tsukada; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0184965

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** peripheral nerve stimulation, graphene electrodes, self-folding, thin-film, bioelectronics, nerve interface, biomedical engineering

**Summary:** The key innovation of this work is the development of **self-folding graphene-based thin-film cuff electrodes** that can autonomously wrap around peripheral nerves, enabled by precise patterning of holes and slits to control folding direction and reduce impedance[1][3]. This approach allows minimally invasive, conformal interfacing with fine nerve fibers and demonstrated effective stimulation of rat sciatic nerves, indicating potential for **highly selective, versatile neural interfaces**. The technology holds significant promise for biorobotics by enabling advanced, flexible, and less damaging nerve interfaces critical for next-generation bioelectronic and neuroprosthetic systems[1][3].
