## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles during attempted movements in a person with tetraplegia

**Authors:** Ajiboye AB; Kirsch RF; Schmit BD

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00415.2021

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** surface EMG, neural decoding, spinal cord injury, assistive devices, motor intention[3]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development of a **wearable myoelectric sensor array**—a sleeve with 150 embedded electrodes—that enables high-resolution recording and real-time decoding of **motor unit firing rates** from paralyzed muscles in a person with tetraplegia during attempted movements[4]. This approach provides the first direct, noninvasive interface with spinal motor neuron output below the level of spinal cord injury, revealing task-specific neural drive even in the absence of visible movement and enabling accurate decoding of motor intention for potential control of assistive or biorobotic devices[4]. This technology represents a significant advance for biorobotics by offering a practical method to sense and interpret residual neural commands, paving the way for intuitive and responsive neuroprosthetic control in individuals with severe paralysis[4].

### Interfacing With Alpha Motor Neurons in Spinal Cord Injury Patients: Decoding and Frequency-Domain Analysis of α-MNs Spike Trains

**Authors:** Negro F; Muceli S; Castronovo AM; Holobar A; Farina D

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2020.00445

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** alpha motor neurons, spike train decoding, spinal cord injury, non-invasive, closed-loop control[4]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **novel non-invasive methodology for decoding and analyzing spike trains from alpha motor neurons (α-MNs) in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients**, enabling robust removal of compromised data and detailed frequency-domain analysis[1][3]. This approach allows real-time estimation of α-MN responses to electrical stimulation, facilitating **closed-loop, model-based control of neurorehabilitation devices** and optimizing stimulation parameters for personalized biorobotic therapies[1]. The innovation holds significant potential for advancing adaptive, patient-specific interventions in biorobotics by providing direct, non-invasive access to spinal motor neuron activity[1][3].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (1 papers)

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain-machine interface

**Authors:** Nuyujukian P; Pandarinath C; Gilja V; Blabe CH; Wang PT; Sarma AA; Sorice BL; Saab J; Franco B; Makinwa K; Kao JC; Stavisky SD; Ryu SI; Shenoy KV; Andersen RA; Kirsch RF; Henderson JM

**DOI:** 10.1371/journal.pone.0092799

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical BMI, finger movement, kinematic decoding, rhesus macaques, Kalman filter[1]

**Summary:** This study demonstrates, for the first time, that **intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can enable real-time neural control of finger-level movements** in rhesus macaques by decoding neural activity from the primary motor cortex using a Kalman filter[1][2]. The key innovation is the successful reconstruction and real-time control of continuous finger kinematics, achieving high accuracy (average correlation ρ = 0.78) and robust performance (average target acquisition rate of 83.1%), marking a significant advance toward **dexterous, fine-motor neural prosthetic control**—a critical step for biorobotics applications requiring precise hand function restoration[1][2].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (1 papers)

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Y. Yamada; S. Himori; S. Tsukada; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0192823

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** peripheral nerve stimulation, graphene electrodes, self-folding, thin-film, bioelectronics, nerve interface[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **self-folding graphene-based thin-film cuff electrode** designed for peripheral nerve stimulation, leveraging patterned holes and material properties to autonomously wrap around nerves for intimate, stable contact[2]. This innovation enables minimally invasive, conformal nerve interfaces with high electrical performance and mechanical flexibility, which are critical for advanced bioelectronic devices in biorobotics. The approach has significant potential to improve chronic neural interfacing and enable more precise, adaptive control in biorobotic systems[2].
