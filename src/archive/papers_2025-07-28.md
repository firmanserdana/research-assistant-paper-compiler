## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### A Qualitative Exploration of EMG Visual Feedback for Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation

**Authors:** Janelle Aikens; Aaron Tabor; Kevin Englehart; Erik Scheme

**DOI:** 10.1109/ICORR66766.2025.11063187

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** EMG feedback, spinal cord injury, rehabilitation, motivation, visual feedback, human-machine interface[1]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the development and qualitative evaluation of an **EMG-based visual feedback tool** designed to enhance motivation and motor learning in spinal cord injury (SCI) hand function rehabilitation[2][1][3]. By providing real-time, tangible indicators of muscle activity, the tool acts as both an extrinsic and intrinsic motivator, supporting patient engagement and communication with therapists across various stages of recovery[2][1][3]. This approach highlights a promising direction for **biorobotics research**, suggesting that integrating EMG visual feedback into human-machine interfaces could bridge subfunctional and functional movement, thereby advancing personalized rehabilitation strategies for individuals with SCI[2][1][3].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (1 papers)

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain-machine interface

**Authors:** ZT Irwin; JF O'Doherty; JH Perge; S Suresh; JH Nason; L Bullard; L Miller

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2017.00006

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical BMI, finger movement, kinematic decoding, Kalman filter, rhesus macaque

**Summary:** The paper introduces a novel intracortical brain-machine interface (BMI) that enables real-time, continuous control of individual finger movements in a rhesus macaque by decoding neural activity from the primary motor cortex using a Kalman filter[3][4]. The key innovation is the demonstration of precise, brain-controlled fingertip position in a virtual environment, isolated from arm movements, providing the first evidence that fine finger kinematics can be directly decoded and used for functional BMI control[3]. This advance has significant implications for biorobotics, as it establishes a foundation for developing dexterous, neurally controlled prosthetic hands capable of restoring complex finger function in individuals with paralysis[4].
