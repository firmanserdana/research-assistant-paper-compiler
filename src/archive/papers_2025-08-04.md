## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### Properties of the surface electromyogram following traumatic spinal cord injury

**Authors:** Not specified in search result (see article for full author list)

**DOI:** 10.1186/s12984-021-00888-2

**TRL:** 2

**Keywords:** surface EMG, spinal cord injury, signal analysis, motor command, biomedical engineering[1]

**Summary:** The paper systematically reviews how surface electromyography (sEMG) properties change following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), highlighting that sEMG can sensitively detect residual motor commands even in muscles below the injury level where clinical movement is absent[1][2]. The key innovation is the recommendation to expand sEMG analysis beyond traditional amplitude-based metrics to include broader time- and frequency-domain features and high-density EMG techniques, which could provide a more comprehensive neurophysiological assessment post-SCI[1]. This advancement has significant potential impact for biorobotics, as richer sEMG characterization could enhance the control and adaptation of assistive devices and neuroprosthetics for individuals with SCI[1][2].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (4 papers)

### Pseudo-linear summation explains neural geometry of multi-finger movements in human motor cortex

**Authors:** Yuxiao Chen; John P. Cunningham

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59039-z

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, multi-finger kinematics, neural geometry, brain-computer interface, non-linear decoder, Utah array

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the demonstration that multi-finger movements in the human motor cortex are represented by a "pseudo-linear summation" of the neural activity patterns corresponding to individual finger movements, with normalization mechanisms preventing simple additive scaling as more fingers are involved[1][2][3]. This compositional coding principle explains the neural geometry underlying complex finger actions and reveals why non-linear decoding methods outperform linear ones for intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)[2][3]. The findings have significant implications for biorobotics, as they provide a principled framework for designing more accurate neural decoders for dexterous multi-finger control in robotic prostheses and advanced BCIs[1][2][3].

### The impact of task context on predicting finger movements in a brain–machine interface

**Authors:** Matthew J. Suresh; John P. Cunningham

**DOI:** 10.7554/eLife.82598

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger kinematics, context generalization, neural manifolds, brain-machine interface, nonhuman primate

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that while offline decoding of finger kinematics and muscle activity from intracortical recordings in nonhuman primates is significantly degraded by changes in task context (such as altered hand posture or resistance), online brain–machine interface (BMI) control remains robust because the neural manifolds underlying finger movements stay aligned across contexts[3][4]. The key innovation is the identification that neural population dynamics shift systematically with context, but this shift can be compensated for during real-time BMI use, highlighting the potential for more adaptable and context-robust neural decoders in biorobotics and neuroprosthetic applications[3][4]. This insight advances the design of BMIs for dexterous hand control in real-world, variable environments.

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain-machine interface

**Authors:** Vikash Gilja; Paul Nuyujukian; Joline M. Fan; et al.

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2014.00042

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger movement, brain-machine interface, Kalman filter, rhesus macaque, neural prosthetics

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates, for the first time, real-time neural control of continuous finger movements using intracortical recordings from the primary motor cortex of rhesus macaques, decoded via a standard Kalman filter[1][3]. The key innovation is the successful translation of neural activity into precise, finger-level kinematics—enabling monkeys to control virtual fingertips with high accuracy and throughput—marking a critical advance toward dexterous, multi-fingered neural prosthetics for biorobotics applications[1][3]. This work establishes a foundational framework for developing brain-machine interfaces capable of restoring fine motor skills in neuroprosthetic devices.

### State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble and LFP activity during dexterous reach-to-grasp movements

**Authors:** Matthew D. Schieber; Nicholas G. Hatsopoulos

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00995.2012

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** hand kinematics, finger kinematics, intracortical decoding, neuronal ensemble, local field potential, reach-to-grasp, state decoder

**Summary:** The paper introduces a state-based decoding framework that combines neuronal ensemble spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) to reconstruct detailed hand and finger kinematics during dexterous reach-to-grasp movements[4]. The key innovation is the use of a state decoder to distinguish behavioral phases (baseline, reaction, movement, hold), enabling a kinematic decoder to more accurately predict joint and endpoint kinematics, with spikes providing superior decoding performance for hand and finger movements compared to other neural signals[4]. This approach enhances the precision of intracortical decoding, offering significant potential for improving the control of biorobotic and neuroprosthetic devices in tasks requiring fine motor skills.

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (3 papers)

### Intrafascicular peripheral nerve stimulation produces fine functional hand movements in primates

**Authors:** G. Valle; S. Mazzoni; F. Iberite; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1126/scitranslmed.abg6463

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** Intrafascicular stimulation, peripheral nerve, hand movement, neuroprosthetics, primate model, brain-controlled interface[4]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the use of just two intrafascicular peripheral nerve electrodes to selectively stimulate the median and radial nerves, enabling primates to perform a wide range of dexterous and functional hand movements, including multiple grips and sustained contractions[1][2]. This approach demonstrates that fine, brain-controlled hand movements can be restored in paralyzed limbs with minimal hardware, offering a promising and clinically relevant strategy for next-generation neuroprosthetic and biorobotics applications[1][2][4].

### Biomimetic computer-to-brain communication enhancing naturalistic sensorimotor control

**Authors:** G. Valle; F. Petrini; S. Raspopovic; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-45190-6

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** Biomimetic feedback, peripheral nerve stimulation, bionic hand, sensorimotor control, neuroprosthetics, closed-loop system[3]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the development of a biomimetic neurostimulation framework that delivers physiologically plausible sensory feedback to the peripheral nervous system, closely mimicking natural touch by leveraging in-silico mechanoreceptor models and advanced stimulation policies[3][2]. This approach, validated in both animal models and clinical trials with amputees, significantly enhances sensorimotor control and reduces cognitive effort compared to traditional methods, representing a major advance for closed-loop biorobotic systems and the next generation of neuroprosthetics[3][2][1].

**Authors:** J. D. Sando; M. D. Svientek; P. D. Marasco

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.021

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** Biomimetic neurostimulation, peripheral nerve, somatosensory feedback, regenerative interface, sensorimotor integration, prosthetic hand[2]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a new paradigm in neuroprosthetics by integrating biomimetic sensory feedback—using neurostimulation techniques that closely replicate natural somatosensory signals—into prosthetic hands, enabling more intuitive and functional sensorimotor integration for users[1]. This approach leverages advanced regenerative interfaces and encoding strategies to deliver biologically relevant tactile information through peripheral nerves, representing a significant advance toward clinically viable, closed-loop biorobotic limbs that mimic natural limb sensation and control[1]. The innovation has the potential to transform biorobotics by bridging the gap between artificial and biological sensorimotor systems, improving prosthetic embodiment and user quality of life[1].
