**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the demonstration that multi-finger movements in the human motor cortex are represented by a "pseudo-linear summation" of the neural activity patterns corresponding to individual finger movements, with normalization mechanisms preventing simple additive scaling as more fingers are involved[1][2][3]. This compositional coding principle explains the neural geometry underlying complex finger actions and reveals why non-linear decoding methods outperform linear ones for intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)[2][3]. The findings have significant implications for biorobotics, as they provide a principled framework for designing more accurate neural decoders for dexterous multi-finger control in robotic prostheses and advanced BCIs[1][2][3]. ---
