**Summary:** The paper shows that multi-finger movements in human premotor cortex are encoded by a **pseudo-linear summation** of single-finger activity: population trajectories for combined movements align with the linear sum of constituent single-finger trajectories, but with two key deviations—global magnitude normalization across finger counts and tuning changes for weakly represented fingers—yielding a low-dimensional geometry (>95% variance in 5 PCs) that supports compositional control[2]. These deviations make **non-linear decoders** outperform linear ones for multi-finger decoding from intracortical threshold crossings and motivate BCI designs that leverage compositional priors for rapid generalization to dexterous skills (e.g., typing, piano) in biorobotics[2][1]. ---
