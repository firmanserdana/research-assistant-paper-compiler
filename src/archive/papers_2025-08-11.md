## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of digital avatars and robotic arms in individuals with tetraplegia

**Authors:** D.S. Oliveira; H. Zandieh; A. D’Anna; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awae245

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** surface EMG, myoelectric decoding, spinal cord–computer interface, tetraplegia, motor intention, robotic control, brain–spine neuroprosthetics[5]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a non-invasive, direct spinal cord–computer interface that decodes volitional motor unit discharges from high-density surface EMG in motor-complete C5–C6 tetraplegia, enabling real-time control of a virtual hand and robotic effectors with more than 10 decoded hand/ digit degrees of freedom and proportional multi-DOF control (e.g., hand open/close, index flex/extend).[2][4] The key innovation is mapping task-modulated spinal motor neuron population activity—accessible via wearable sensors—into continuous control signals, demonstrating that spared spinal pathways can be harnessed years post-injury without brain implants.[2] For biorobotics, this establishes a scalable myoelectric decoding pathway for dexterous avatar/robotic arm control and a platform to integrate with neuroprosthetics and closed-loop assistive systems that leverage residual spinal circuitry.[2][1]

### Development and evaluation of a non‑invasive brain–spine interface combining EEG and transcutaneous stimulation in SCI

**Authors:** C. Atkinson; A. Jochumsen; A. Wongsarnpigoon; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1186/s12984-025-01628-6

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** non‑invasive BSI, EEG decoding, EMG monitoring, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, closed‑loop rehabilitation, gait/standing support[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a non-invasive brain–spine interface that decodes lower-limb motor intent from EEG in real time to trigger transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, closing the loop with simultaneous EMG monitoring to reinforce volitional activation in individuals with spinal cord injury.[4] According to the authors, this proof-of-concept advances prior non-invasive BSIs by coupling EEG decoding with transcutaneous (rather than magnetic) spinal neuromodulation, aiming for scalable, clinic-ready closed-loop rehabilitation to support tasks like gait or standing and enabling exploration of generalized versus personalized decoders for broader deployment.[4][3] For biorobotics, the key impact is a deployable control architecture that links cortical intent to spinal circuitry non-invasively, complementing robotic gait/stance assist devices and potentially improving timing, personalization, and adaptability of neurorehabilitation compared with open-loop or invasive BSI approaches.[4][5]

**Authors:** [Author list not fully visible in preview; Nature Medicine paper—use full citation when available]

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41591-024-03341-8[3]

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical BCI, finger kinematics, continuous decoding, multi-DOF control, human paralysis, primary motor cortex, virtual interface control[3]

**Summary:** This Nature Medicine study demonstrates an intracortical BCI that continuously decodes individuated finger kinematics from human primary motor cortex to control three independent finger groups, with 2D thumb movement, achieving a total of four degrees of freedom—doubling prior NHP continuous finger-DOF—and high performance in real time (≈76 targets/min; 1.58 ± 0.06 s acquisition) in a participant with tetraplegia[1][4]. The decoded finger positions were mapped to a virtual quadcopter’s 4-DOF velocity control, showcasing an intuitive brain-to-finger-to-interface mapping that can generalize to multi-DOF end-effectors and complex digital or robotic manipulators[1][3].

Key biorobotics impact: the finger-centric intermediate representation provides a scalable control layer for dexterous, multi-DOF robotic hands and virtual interfaces, potentially enabling tasks like typing and fine manipulation with more natural, modular control than direct ef

### Pseudo-linear summation explains neural geometry of multi-finger movements in human motor cortex

**Authors:** [Author list not fully visible in preview; Nature Communications paper—use full citation when available]

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59039-z[2]

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** multi-finger decoding, neural population geometry, non-linear decoders, threshold crossings, low-dimensional manifolds, finger velocity/position tuning[2]

**Summary:** The paper shows that multi-finger movements in human premotor cortex are encoded by a **pseudo-linear summation** of single-finger activity: population trajectories for combined movements align with the linear sum of constituent single-finger trajectories, but with two key deviations—global magnitude normalization across finger counts and tuning changes for weakly represented fingers—yielding a low-dimensional geometry (>95% variance in 5 PCs) that supports compositional control[2]. These deviations make **non-linear decoders** outperform linear ones for multi-finger decoding from intracortical threshold crossings and motivate BCI designs that leverage compositional priors for rapid generalization to dexterous skills (e.g., typing, piano) in biorobotics[2][1].

### State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble and LFP activity during dexterous reach-to-grasp movements

**Authors:** Shanechi MM; Hu RC; Powers M; Wornell GW; Brown EN; Williams ZM

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.01038.2011[5]

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** state decoder, Kalman filter, LFP, spiking activity, reach-to-grasp, hand aperture, continuous kinematics decoding[5]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a state-space decoder that fuses multiunit spiking and local field potential (LFP) features within a Kalman filter framework to continuously decode both arm kinematics and fine hand parameters (e.g., finger position and hand aperture) during natural reach-to-grasp. By explicitly modeling task-dependent state dynamics and leveraging complementary neural modalities, it achieves accurate, low-latency decoding of dexterous hand/finger movements beyond traditional velocity-only or spike-only decoders.

For biorobotics, this enables more naturalistic, multi-DOF prosthetic and robotic hand control by providing stable continuous estimates of grasp shaping in addition to reach, supporting closed-loop manipulation and dexterous assistive systems that can function with robust LFP signals when spike quality degrades.

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain–machine interface

**Authors:** Shanechi MM; Hu RC; Powers M; Wornell GW; Brown EN; Williams ZM

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00485.2013[1]

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** finger-level control, rhesus macaque, intracortical spikes, Kalman filter, virtual fingertip targets, information throughput[1]

**Summary:** This study demonstrates the first brain control of fine, **finger-level kinematics** in rhesus macaques by decoding intracortical spikes to continuously control a virtual fingertip using a **Kalman filter**, achieving offline position correlation ρ≈0.78 and real-time target acquisition ≈83% with **~1.01 bits/s information throughput**[1][2]. The key innovation is a behavioral paradigm for precise virtual fingertip targeting paired with standard spike-based decoding to realize continuous single-finger aperture control, moving BMIs beyond whole-arm control to dexterous hand function[1][2].

For biorobotics, this establishes a practical pathway to integrate intracortical decoding for **dexterous hand prostheses**, quantifies achievable **throughput** at the finger level comparable to cursor BMIs, and provides a validated task/decoder framework to benchmark next-generation, multi-finger prosthetic controllers and sensory-feedback systems[1][2].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (3 papers)

### Biomimetic computer-to-brain communication enhancing artificial sensory perception

**Authors:** Greta Valle; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-45190-6

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** peripheral nerve stimulation, biomimetic stimulation, sensory feedback, bionic hand, closed-loop neuroprosthesis, time-variant stimulation, somatosensory dynamics[2]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **biomimetic neurostimulation framework** that encodes touch by driving peripheral nerves with time‑variant patterns derived from an in‑silico mechanoreceptor model, yielding spatiotemporal neural activity that closely matches natural touch and propagates to dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord in cats[3][2]. Implemented in a **closed-loop bionic hand**, this strategy improved mobility (primary outcome) and reduced mental workload (secondary outcome) in amputees compared to conventional linear stimulation, indicating more intuitive, naturalistic sensory feedback[3][2]. For biorobotics, the key impact is establishing physiologically plausible, sensory‑dynamic encoding as a design principle for next‑generation neuroprostheses and robot–nervous‑system interfaces that enable more robust, low‑cognitive‑load human–machine interaction[3][2].

### Dynamic peripheral nerve stimulation can produce cortical responses that resemble natural touch

**Authors:** J. Tanner; et al.

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnhum.2023.1083307

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** dynamic stimulation, somatosensory cortex, vibrotactile, punctate stimulation, charge-balanced pulses, peripheral nerve interface, biomimetic encoding[1]

**Summary:** The paper’s key innovation is a **dynamic, biomimetic peripheral nerve stimulation** strategy—using time-varying, charge-balanced pulse trains—that drives somatosensory cortical activity patterns closely resembling those from natural punctate and vibrotactile touch.[1] By showing that peripheral biomimetic encoding can reproduce naturalistic spatiotemporal dynamics upstream in the CNS, it supports next‑generation **biorobotic neuroprostheses** that deliver more intuitive, low‑effort, real‑time sensory feedback for control and mobility.[1][2]

For biorobotics, this implies improved embodiment and performance when sensor signals (e.g., from prosthetic feet or hands) are converted on‑the‑fly into **physiologically plausible** stimulation patterns, which has already yielded higher mobility and reduced cognitive load compared with discrete or linear encoders in neuro‑robotic implementations.[1][2]

**Authors:** [AIP Advances authors; not listed in snippet]

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0220690

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** graphene cuff electrode, self-folding thin film, parylene, peripheral nerve stimulation, electrochemical impedance, nerve cuff, 2D materials[4]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **self-folding graphene thin-film cuff electrode** that uses patterned holes and slits in a parylene-based stack to program folding direction, enabling the film to autonomously wrap around peripheral nerves while reducing electrode–electrolyte impedance via slit-mediated ionic access[1][2]. In vivo on rat sciatic nerve, the cuff reliably wrapped and evoked leg movement with 1 Hz stimulation, and ~80% of devices folded in the intended direction, highlighting a minimally invasive route to interface with finer nerve fibers[1][2]. For biorobotics, this design offers a lightweight, conformal, and scalable nerve interface leveraging **2D graphene** conductivity and low-impedance access for stable stimulation, potentially improving closed-loop motor control and selective neuromodulation in soft robotic systems[1][2].
