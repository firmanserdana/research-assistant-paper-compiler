## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of paralyzed hands in humans

**Authors:** D.S. Oliveira; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awae234

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** spinal cord–computer interface, EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, hand control, neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation robotics[4]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development of a **non-invasive spinal cord–computer interface** that decodes voluntary motor unit activity from spared neural pathways in individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury, enabling real-time control of multiple hand movements[1][4]. This approach demonstrates that wearable muscle sensors can access and translate residual spinal motor neuron signals into functional hand control, offering a promising avenue for **restoring dexterous movement via neuroprosthetics and rehabilitation robotics** in paralyzed patients[1][4].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### A high-performance brain–computer interface for finger-based control

**Authors:** MS Willsey; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41591-024-03341-8

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** intracortical BCI, finger kinematics, continuous decoding, human participant, multi-DOF control[3]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the development of a high-performance intracortical brain–computer interface (BCI) that enables continuous, multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) decoding of three independent finger groups—including two-dimensional thumb movement—in a human participant with paralysis, effectively doubling the number of decoded DOFs compared to prior non-human primate studies[2][3]. This system allowed intuitive, individuated finger-based control of a virtual quadcopter, demonstrating the potential for naturalistic and versatile manipulation of digital and robotic interfaces. The approach represents a significant advance for biorobotics by enabling more dexterous, human-like control of robotic devices, opening new possibilities for prosthetic function, digital interaction, and rehabilitation technologies[2][3].

### Pseudo-linear summation explains neural geometry of multi-finger movements in human motor cortex

**Authors:** NP Shah; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59039-z

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger movement, neural population coding, non-linear decoder, Utah array[2]

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **multi-finger movements in the human motor cortex are represented by a pseudo-linear summation of individual finger movement neural codes, with normalization and finger-specific deviations from pure linearity**[2][3][1]. This insight enables more accurate intracortical decoding—especially with non-linear decoders—potentially advancing biorobotics by informing the design of brain-computer interfaces capable of dexterous, multi-finger control for applications such as robotic hands or prosthetics[2][3].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (1 papers)

### Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation

**Authors:** Shogo Himori; Shingo Tsukada; Yuriko Furukawa

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0188522

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** graphene electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, thin-film, bioelectronics, in vivo, nerve interface[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **self-folding graphene-based thin-film cuff electrode** designed for peripheral nerve stimulation, featuring micro-patterned holes and slits that enable precise, controllable self-folding to wrap around nerves[1]. This innovation allows for minimally invasive, conformal nerve interfaces with high biocompatibility and the potential to stimulate thinner nerve fibers, expanding applications in **bioelectronic devices and biorobotics** for advanced neural interfacing and multifunctional biosensing[1].
