### Pseudo-linear summation explains neural geometry of multi-finger movements in human motor cortex
**Authors:** NP Shah; et al.
**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-59039-z

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger movement, neural population coding, non-linear decoder, Utah array[2]
**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **multi-finger movements in the human motor cortex are represented by a pseudo-linear summation of individual finger movement neural codes, with normalization and finger-specific deviations from pure linearity**[2][3][1]. This insight enables more accurate intracortical decoding—especially with non-linear decoders—potentially advancing biorobotics by informing the design of brain-computer interfaces capable of dexterous, multi-finger control for applications such as robotic hands or prosthetics[2][3]. --- ## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (1 papers)
