## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### Sensing and Decoding the Neural Drive to Paralyzed Muscles After Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** J E Ting; S E Harkema; R R Requejo; V R Edgerton

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00484.2021

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** **surface EMG, motor intention decoding, spinal cord injury, wearable sensors, assistive robotics, residual myoelectric activity**[2]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the demonstration that **wearable surface EMG sensors** can noninvasively detect and decode **residual motor unit activity** in paralyzed muscles of individuals with chronic cervical spinal cord injury, even when no visible movement occurs[4]. By extracting volitional motor unit recruitment patterns and classifying single-digit movement intentions offline, the study establishes a foundation for translating **motor intention decoding** into **assistive biorobotic systems** without the need for implanted electrodes, significantly advancing the accessibility and practicality of neural interfaces for rehabilitation and robotic control[4].

### A Direct Spinal Cord–Computer Interface Enables the Control of Paralyzed Muscles in Humans

**Authors:** D S Oliveira; [additional authors not listed in snippet]

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awad265

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** **spinal cord-computer interface, EMG decoding, motor control, spinal cord injury, neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation robotics**[5]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **non-invasive spinal cord–computer interface** that decodes voluntary control signals from spared motor neurons in individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury, enabling real-time control of paralyzed hand muscles and multiple degrees of freedom[1][4][5]. This innovation demonstrates that even after severe injury, residual neural pathways can be harnessed for **precise motor control**, offering a new avenue for neuroprosthetic and rehabilitation robotics development by directly interfacing with spinal motor circuits rather than relying solely on brain signals[1][4][5].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### Decoding Handwriting Trajectories from Intracortical Brain Signals

**Authors:** Y. Zhang; J. Wang; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1002/advs.202505492

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, handwriting, hand kinematics, brain-computer interface, neural signal processing[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a method for **decoding precise handwriting trajectories from intracortical neural signals** recorded during attempted handwriting in a human participant[3][4]. The key innovation is the reconstruction of detailed hand kinematics directly from brain activity, enabling accurate and temporally-resolved tracking of handwriting movements, which advances neural signal processing for brain-computer interfaces[3][4]. This approach has significant implications for biorobotics, as it provides a foundation for developing neuroprosthetic devices capable of restoring fine motor control and naturalistic handwriting in individuals with paralysis[3][4].

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain-machine interface

**Authors:** S. N. S. Ethier; A. Oby; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00651.2013

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger kinematics, Kalman filter, rhesus macaque, neural prosthetics[1]

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the **first successful real-time neural control of fine finger movements** using an intracortical brain-machine interface in rhesus macaques, employing a Kalman filter to decode finger kinematics from primary motor cortex activity[1][2]. The key innovation is the continuous, biomimetic decoding of finger-level motion—rather than whole-arm movements—enabling monkeys to control virtual fingertip positions with high accuracy and information throughput comparable to upper-arm BMI systems[1][2]. This advance significantly enhances the prospects for **dexterous neural prosthetics** in biorobotics, paving the way for more naturalistic and precise control of robotic hands for individuals with motor disabilities[1][2].
