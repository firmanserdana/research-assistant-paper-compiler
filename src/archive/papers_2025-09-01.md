**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the demonstration of **real-time, intracortical brain-machine interface (BMI) control of continuous finger movements** in rhesus macaques, using neural signals decoded with a standard Kalman filter to achieve fine, finger-level motor control[1][2]. This represents the first evidence that BMIs can enable dexterous, finger-specific control—previously limited to whole-arm or gross hand movements—achieving an average target acquisition rate of 83.1% and information throughput comparable to upper-arm BMI systems[1][2]. The findings significantly advance biorobotics by paving the way for **more dexterous neural prosthetics** capable of restoring precise hand function to individuals with severe motor disabilities[1][2].
