## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### Sensing and Decoding the Neural Drive to Paralyzed Muscles During Volitional Motor Attempt After Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** Brian A. Cramer; Daniel B. McFarland; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00593.2021

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, neural drive, exoskeleton, myoelectric control, assistive devices

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **wearable interface that records and decodes the firing rates of motor units in paralyzed muscles below the level of spinal cord injury during voluntary movement attempts**[5]. This approach enables extraction of the residual neural drive from muscles that appear clinically paralyzed, providing a more direct and precise control signal than conventional EMG for assistive devices such as exoskeletons[5]. The key innovation has significant implications for biorobotics, as it could enable more intuitive and effective myoelectric control of robotic assistive technologies for individuals with severe motor impairments after spinal cord injury[5].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### Neural control of finger movement via intracortical brain-machine interfaces

**Authors:** Nuyujukian P; Pandarinath C; Foster JD; Kao JC; Blabe CH; Sorice BL; Saab J; Franco B; Mernoff ST; Nurmikko AV; Donoghue JP; Hochberg LR; Shenoy KV

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00651.2017

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger kinematics, brain-machine interface, Kalman filter, rhesus macaque[1]

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the first successful **continuous neural decoding and real-time brain control of finger-level fine motor skills** in rhesus macaques using intracortical electrode arrays and a standard Kalman filter, achieving an average correlation of 0.78 between actual and predicted finger positions and enabling monkeys to acquire virtual fingertip targets with high accuracy[2][3]. The key innovation is the precise, real-time decoding of individual finger kinematics, representing a major advance toward **dexterous neural prosthetic control** and laying foundational groundwork for biorobotics systems capable of restoring or augmenting fine finger movements in humans with motor disabilities[2][3].

### Decoding hand kinetics and kinematics using somatosensory cortex signals in active and passive tasks

**Authors:** Salehi S; Abbasi L; Farivar M; Shamsollahi MB; Nasrabadi AM

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2023.1050930

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** somatosensory cortex, hand kinematics, kinetic decoding, state-based decoder, proprioception[3]

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **hand kinematics and kinetics can be accurately decoded from neural signals in area 2 of the somatosensory cortex (S1) during both active and passive tasks**, using both conventional and state-based decoders[1]. The key innovation is the use of a state-based decoding algorithm optimized separately for active and passive conditions, revealing distinct cortical encoding strategies and enabling high-accuracy reconstruction of hand movement parameters, including direction, trajectory, joint angles, force, and moment[1]. This approach highlights the potential of somatosensory cortex signals for **enhanced biorobotic control and proprioceptive feedback**, advancing neuroprosthetic and brain-machine interface technologies[1].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (1 papers)

### **Self-folding graphene cuff electrodes for peripheral nerve stimulation**

**Authors:** Y. Kim; S. Himori; S. Tsukada

**DOI:** 10.1063/5.0143499

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **graphene electrodes, peripheral nerve stimulation, bioelectronics, thin-film devices, neural interface**

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the development of **self-folding graphene-based thin-film cuff electrodes** that autonomously wrap around peripheral nerves, enabled by precise patterning of holes and slits to control folding direction and reduce impedance[1][2][3][4]. This design allows minimally invasive, conformal interfacing with fine nerve fibers and demonstrated effective motor neuron stimulation in vivo, as evidenced by induced leg movement in rats[1][2][3][4]. The approach offers significant potential for biorobotics by enabling versatile, low-damage neural interfaces critical for advanced bioelectronic control and next-generation neural prosthetics[1][2][3][4].
