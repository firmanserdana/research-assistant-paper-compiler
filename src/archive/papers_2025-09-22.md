## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (2 papers)

### **Multimodal Decoding and Congruent Sensory Information Enhance Reaching Performance in Spinal Cord Injury**

**Authors:** Emily Corbett; Patrick W. Franks; et al.

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2014.00123

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EMG decoding, multimodal interface, gaze tracking, spinal cord injury, robot-assisted rehabilitation

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is a **multimodal interface** that combines **EMG decoding** and **gaze tracking** to control robot-assisted reaching in individuals with cervical spinal cord injury, enabling accurate and straight reaches even in subjects with severe impairment[1][2][4]. The study demonstrates that integrating disparate signal sources and providing **congruent sensory (proprioceptive) feedback** significantly enhances reaching performance, highlighting the potential for sensor fusion approaches in biorobotics to improve neuroprosthetic control for highly impaired users[1][2][4].

### **Brain Decoder Controls Spinal Cord Stimulation**

**Authors:** Ismael Seáñez; Carolyn Atkinson; et al.

**DOI:** 10.1186/s12984-025-01345-2

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** brain-spine interface, EEG decoding, spinal cord stimulation, rehabilitation robotics, noninvasive neurotechnology

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **noninvasive brain-spine interface** that uses real-time EEG decoding to trigger transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, enabling voluntary movement in response to both actual and imagined motor intent[1][3][4]. The key innovation is the use of a brain decoder that reliably detects movement intention and directly controls spinal stimulation, representing a significant advance for **rehabilitation robotics** and biorobotics by potentially restoring motor function after spinal cord injury without invasive procedures[2][3]. This approach lays the groundwork for adaptable neurotechnologies that could be generalized for broader clinical use in motor rehabilitation[2][3].
