### EMG Triggered Closed-Loop Stimulation for Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** Wu-17-18 (clinical trial, principal investigator not specified in search result)

**DOI:** N/A

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** EMG-triggered stimulation, closed-loop, spinal cord stimulation, motor recovery, rehabilitation

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development and clinical testing of a **closed-loop spinal cord stimulation system triggered by real-time electromyography (EMG) signals**, enabling stimulation to be precisely timed to voluntary muscle activity in individuals with spinal cord injury[3][1]. This EMG-triggered approach, when combined with physical retraining, resulted in **greater motor recovery** compared to non-triggered stimulation or physical training alone, demonstrating significant potential for adaptive, activity-dependent neuromodulation in biorobotics and neurorehabilitation[3][1]. This technology advances the field by providing a responsive interface that dynamically links patient intent to therapeutic stimulation, supporting more effective and personalized motor rehabilitation strategies[1][3].
