### **A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand by decoding motor neuron activity**

**Authors:** **Martín G. B. Schiavone; Juan C. Moreno-López; et al.**

**DOI:** **10.1093/brain/awad277**

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** **HDsEMG decomposition, motor unit decoding, spinal cord injury, neural interface, real-time control**

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is a **non-invasive spinal cord–computer interface** that uses high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) to decode motor unit activity from spared spinal motor neurons in individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury, enabling real-time, proportional control of multiple hand movements[1][2]. This approach demonstrates that even after severe paralysis, residual voluntary control of motor neurons can be harnessed for intuitive and multi-degree-of-freedom hand function restoration without the need for invasive implants[1][2]. The technology has significant potential for biorobotics, as it provides a clinically viable, wearable neural interface for controlling assistive devices such as exoskeletons and prosthetics, advancing the field toward practical, non-surgical solutions for movement restoration[1][2].

### **Fusion of EEG and EMG signals for detecting pre-movement intentions in spinal cord injured patients**

**Authors:** **Jiawei Zhang; Yuxin Liu; et al.**

**DOI:** **10.3389/fnins.2025.1532099**

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **EEG-EMG fusion, movement intention decoding, spinal cord injury, functional connectivity, lower limb rehabilitation**

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is a **multimodal fusion method leveraging EEG-EMG functional connectivity networks** to detect pre-movement intentions (sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, rest) in spinal cord injured patients, achieving significantly higher accuracy (up to 94.33%) than single-modality approaches and demonstrating robustness even under muscular fatigue[1]. This approach enables **earlier and more reliable detection of motor intentions**, which can facilitate more responsive and effective biorobotic rehabilitation systems for lower limb function in SCI patients[1]. The method’s improved accuracy and timing have strong potential to advance human-machine interfaces in biorobotics, supporting real-time, intention-driven assistive devices[1].

### **Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles during attempted movements after spinal cord injury**

**Authors:** **Dario Farina; et al.**

**DOI:** **10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2021.12.012**

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **wearable EMG sensors, neural drive, motor unit decomposition, spinal cord injury, movement attempt detection**

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **wearable EMG sensor array** combined with **motor unit decomposition** and machine learning to non-invasively detect and decode residual neural drive in paralyzed muscles of individuals with chronic spinal cord injury, even when no visible movement occurs[2]. The key innovation is the demonstration that **attempted movements can be reliably classified and decoded from myoelectric signals and motor unit firing rates below the injury level**, enabling accurate detection of movement intent for potential real-time control of assistive or biorobotic devices[2]. This approach could significantly advance biorobotics by providing a non-invasive, intuitive neural interface for restoring function in people with severe paralysis[2].
