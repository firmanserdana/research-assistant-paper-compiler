Minetto; Francesca Pisotta; Silvia Ferreri; Francesca Ferreri; Silvia Rossi; Andrea Cavallo; Valentina Mazzoleni; Marco Iosa; Marco Molinari; Silvia Sterzi; Francesco Lacquaniti; Francesco Posteraro; Francesco Negro

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awae232

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** spinal cord injury, EMG decoding, motor unit decomposition, virtual hand control, neural interface[1]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **direct spinal cord–computer interface** that enables individuals with tetraplegia to control virtual and robotic hands by non-invasively decoding spinal motor neuron activity using high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)[3]. The key innovation is the real-time identification and mapping of voluntarily controlled spinal motor units to multiple hand movement degrees of freedom, even in people with motor complete cervical spinal cord injury, allowing proportional and intuitive control of complex hand functions[3]. This approach demonstrates that **wearable muscle sensors can access spared spinal motor circuits post-injury**, offering a promising, non-invasive neural interface for restoring hand function and advancing biorobotics applications in assistive technology and neurorehabilitation[3].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### **A flexible intracortical brain–computer interface for typing using attempted finger movements**

**Authors:** Francis R. Willett; Jaimie M. Henderson; Krishna V. Shenoy

**DOI:** 10.1073/pnas.2319874121

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** intracortical BCI, finger velocity decoding, neural network, typing, motor cortex

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **flexible intracortical brain–computer interface (BCI) that enables typing by decoding attempted finger movements using neural activity from the motor cortex**. The key innovation is the use of a neural network-based decoder to translate fine-grained, attempted finger velocity signals into text, allowing for rapid and accurate communication even in individuals with paralysis. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of high-speed, dexterous neural decoding, which could significantly advance biorobotics by enabling more natural and efficient control of robotic devices or prosthetics through intuitive, finger-level motor intentions[1][2][3].

### **Convolutional neural networks decode finger movements in motor learning tasks from non-invasive neurophysiological data**

**Authors:** Giulia Borra; Alessandro Gozzi; Silvia Galli; Marco Buiatti; Gianluca Baldassarre

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2024.120621

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** finger movement decoding, convolutional neural network, MEG, motor learning, neurorehabilitation

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **compact, physiologically interpretable convolutional neural network (LF-CNN)** that decodes individual finger movements from non-invasive MEG data during motor learning tasks, achieving high accuracy (80–85% for finger identification) with low computational cost and interpretable spatial and spectral features[1][2]. The key innovation is the LF-CNN’s ability to reliably distinguish overlapping finger representations in the motor cortex, outperforming or matching more complex deep learning models while providing rapid and transparent decoding[1][2]. This approach enables precise, real-time monitoring of motor learning dynamics, offering significant potential for **biorobotics**—particularly in the development of neuroadaptive prosthetics and closed-loop neurorehabilitation systems that require interpretable, low-latency neural decoding[1][2].
