## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### A direct spinal cord–computer interface enables the control of the paralyzed hand

**Authors:** Ismael Seáñez; Carolyn Atkinson; Daniel J. McGinnis; Michael R. Bruchas; Eric C. Leuthardt

**DOI:** 10.1093/brain/awad272

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** spinal cord–computer interface, EMG decoding, motor unit decomposition, spinal cord injury, real-time control[4]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is a **non-invasive spinal cord–computer interface** that decodes voluntary motor unit activity from spared spinal motor neurons in individuals with complete cervical spinal cord injury, enabling real-time, proportional control of multiple hand movements through wearable muscle sensors[1][2]. This approach demonstrates that even after years of paralysis, residual neural pathways can be harnessed to control virtual or potentially robotic hands with multiple degrees of freedom, offering a promising, clinically translatable pathway for restoring hand function and advancing biorobotics research in assistive device integration[1][2].

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2560/9/4/045005

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger kinematics, Kalman filter, brain-machine interface, rhesus macaque[1]

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates the **first successful real-time neural decoding and brain control of finger-level fine motor skills** in rhesus macaques using intracortical electrode arrays and a standard Kalman filter, achieving continuous reconstruction of grasp aperture with high accuracy (average correlation ρ = 0.78) and enabling monkeys to control virtual fingertip positions with an average target acquisition rate of 83.1%[1][2]. The key innovation is the development of a novel behavioral paradigm for isolating finger movements and the application of intracortical decoding algorithms to achieve dexterous finger control, marking a significant advance toward **fully dexterous neural prosthetic devices**.

This approach provides a technical foundation for biorobotics by enabling precise, high-throughput neural control of finger kinematics, which is critical for developing advanced prosthetic hands and robotic manipulators capable of fine motor tasks[1][2].
