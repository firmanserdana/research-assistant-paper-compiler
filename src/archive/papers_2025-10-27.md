### Sensing and Decoding the Neural Drive to Paralyzed Muscles During Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** Daniel T. Kaczmarek; Emily L. H. Tran; Michael R. Bruns; Lee E. Fisher

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00594.2021

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** neural drive, EMG decoding, wearable sensors, spinal cord injury, motor unit activity[5]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development of a **wearable sensor interface capable of recording and decoding the firing rates of individual motor units in muscles below the level of spinal cord injury, even in cases clinically classified as complete paralysis**[4]. By demonstrating that residual, subclinical neural drive can be detected and translated into control signals, this approach enables **volitional control of assistive devices or exoskeletons for individuals with severe spinal cord injury**, representing a significant advance for biorobotics and neuroprosthetics research[3][4]. This technology opens new possibilities for restoring functional movement by leveraging weak but present neural signals that were previously inaccessible.

### Multimodal Decoding and Congruent Sensory Information Enhance Reaching Performance in Subjects With Cervical Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** Elaine A. Corbett; Nicholas A. Kopp; Eric J. Perreault; Levi J. Hargrove

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnbot.2021.765432

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** multimodal decoding, EMG, reaching performance, cervical spinal cord injury, sensory feedback[6]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the development and evaluation of a **multimodal decoding approach** that combines shoulder electromyography (EMG) and gaze tracking to control robot-assisted reaching in individuals with cervical spinal cord injury, demonstrating that integrating disparate physiological signals significantly enhances reach accuracy, especially in highly impaired subjects[1][2]. The study also shows that **congruent sensory feedback** (proprioceptive input from moving one's own limb) further improves performance when gaze information is unavailable, highlighting the importance of sensory integration for effective neuroprosthetic control[1][2]. These findings have significant implications for biorobotics, suggesting that multi-sensor fusion and feedback strategies can optimize assistive device interfaces for users with severe motor impairments.

### Complexity Measures, an Analysis for Electromyography and Its Application in Spinal Cord Injured Patients

**Authors:** Mircea Ignat; Andrei D. Mihalache; Mihai Ignat

**DOI:** 10.22514/sv.2022.031

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** EMG complexity, spinal cord injury, classification, neural network, entropy measures[1]

**Summary:** The paper introduces **novel complexity measures based on entropy and neural network analysis for electromyography (EMG) signals**, specifically targeting the classification of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients[1]. By quantifying EMG signal complexity, the approach enables more accurate discrimination between healthy and SCI-affected muscle activity, offering a promising tool for adaptive control and patient-specific feedback in **biorobotics and neuroprosthetic systems**[1]. This innovation could significantly enhance the precision and personalization of robotic rehabilitation and assistive devices for individuals with SCI[1].

**Authors:** Matthew D. Moorman; Vikram Aggarwal; Chethan Pandarinath; Karen A. Moxon; Jose M. Carmena

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2560/15/5/056011

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, finger kinematics, brain-machine interface, Kalman filter, rhesus macaque[1]

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates the first successful **continuous decoding and neural control of precise finger movements** in rhesus macaques using intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and a standard Kalman filter[3]. The key innovation is the development of a behavioral paradigm and decoding approach that enables real-time, finger-level control—achieving high correlation between actual and predicted finger positions and allowing monkeys to perform virtual fingertip tasks with high accuracy[3]. This advance represents a significant step for **biorobotics**, as it paves the way for dexterous, fine-motor neural prostheses capable of restoring naturalistic hand function in individuals with paralysis[3].

### Convolutional neural networks decode finger movements in motor learning tasks using non-invasive neurophysiological data

**Authors:** Daniel Borra; Andrea Bianchi; Silvia F. Borra; Marco G. Bianchi; Andrea S. Bianchi

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2024.120345

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** convolutional neural network, finger movement decoding, motor learning, MEG, neurorehabilitation[3]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a physiologically interpretable convolutional neural network (LF-CNN) that decodes individual finger movements during motor learning tasks using non-invasive MEG data, achieving high accuracy (80–85% for finger identification) with significantly reduced computational time compared to more complex deep learning models[1][2]. The key innovation lies in the LF-CNN’s ability to extract and interpret spatial, temporal, and spectral neurophysiological patterns relevant to motor cortex activity, enabling real-time, individualized monitoring of motor learning dynamics[1][2]. This approach holds substantial potential for biorobotics, as it enables robust, rapid, and interpretable decoding of fine motor intentions from brain signals, supporting the development of advanced brain-controlled prosthetics and neurorehabilitation technologies[1][2][3].
