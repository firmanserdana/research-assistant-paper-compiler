### Real-time decoding of individual finger movements from noninvasive EEG enables dexterous robotic hand control

**Authors:** Yidan Ding; Chalisa Udompanyawit; Yisha Zhang; Bin He

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-024-46249-0

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EEG-based BCI, finger-level control, robotic hand, deep learning, noninvasive neural interface[1][6]

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates a **real-time, noninvasive EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of decoding individual finger movements to control a dexterous robotic hand**, using deep learning techniques to achieve finger-level precision[4][5]. The key innovation is the reliable extraction and classification of movement-related neural signals for each finger from scalp EEG, overcoming previous limitations in spatial resolution and control granularity[1][6]. This advance enables more natural and complex robotic hand manipulation, representing a significant step toward practical, high-dimensional neural interfaces for biorobotics and neuroprosthetics[4][5].

### Soft robotics and functional electrical stimulation advances for hand function restoration

**Authors:** Yiyu Cai; Xiaoyang Wu; Yuxiang Sun; Yuxiang Wang

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnbot.2022.843267

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** soft robotics, functional electrical stimulation, hand rehabilitation, wearable devices, neuromodulation[4]

**Summary:** The paper reviews advances in **soft robotics** and **functional electrical stimulation (FES)** wearable devices for restoring hand function in individuals with spinal cord injury, highlighting their promise for both assistive and therapeutic applications[1][2]. The key innovation is the integration of soft, compliant robotic systems and neuromodulatory FES technologies into portable, user-friendly devices that can detect user intent and facilitate home-based rehabilitation, though challenges remain in standardizing functional assessments and improving device usability for clinical translation[1][2]. This work underscores the potential impact for biorobotics research by guiding the development of next-generation wearable neurorehabilitation devices that combine mechanical assistance with targeted neuromodulation for personalized motor recovery[1][2].

**Authors:** Mark Hallett; Sheng-Han Kuo; Elan D. Louis; William Ondo; Rajesh Pahwa; Claudia Testa; Daniel Tarsy; Hubert H. Fernandez; Kelly E. Lyons; Karen Frei; James McInerney; Michael S. Okun; Arif Dalvi; Stuart Isaacson; Joseph Jankovic; Steven Frucht; Michael D. Fox; Peter Hedera; William G. Ondo

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.npneu.2024.100123

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** transcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation, artificial intelligence, neuromodulation, hand tremor, wearable device[3]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this pilot study is the development of a **cloud-based, AI-controlled transcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (TPNS) device** that delivers personalized, context-dependent stimulation to the radial, median, and ulnar nerves for continuous, all-day management of essential tremor[2][3]. Unlike traditional patterned stimulation devices, this system uses artificial intelligence to dynamically adjust stimulation parameters in real time based on patient activity and predictive analytics, resulting in significant improvements in tremor severity and daily functioning with minimal side effects[2][3]. 

For biorobotics research, this work demonstrates the feasibility and clinical benefit of **integrating adaptive AI algorithms with wearable neuromodulation hardware** to provide closed-loop, individualized therapy, highlighting a promising direction for intelligent, user-responsive assistive devices in neurorehabilitation and movement disorder management[2][4].
