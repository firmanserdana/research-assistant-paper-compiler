## Emg Decoding On Spinal Cord Injured Patients (1 papers)

### Sensing and Decoding the Neural Drive to Paralyzed Muscles During Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** Dario Farina; Francesco Negro; Silvia Muceli; Alessandro Del Vecchio

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2021.785818

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** neural drive, EMG decomposition, spinal cord injury, motor unit, wearable sensors, motor control

**Summary:** This paper demonstrates that **wearable electrode arrays combined with machine learning can noninvasively record and decode motor unit firing rates in paralyzed muscles of individuals with motor complete spinal cord injury, even when no visible movement occurs**[3][4][5]. The key innovation is the extraction of task-specific neural drive signals from residual motor unit activity using EMG decomposition, enabling accurate classification of movement intent and simulated real-time control of virtual limbs[3][4]. This approach has significant potential for **biorobotics**, as it provides a practical, noninvasive interface for controlling assistive devices based on volitional motor commands in severely paralyzed patients[3][4].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### Real-time decoding of individual finger movements from noninvasive brain signals enables dexterous robotic hand control

**Authors:** Yidan Ding; Chalisa Udompanyawit; Yisha Zhang; Bin He

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41467-025-60818-x

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** EEG-based BCI, finger-level robotic control, deep learning, noninvasive neurotechnology[2]

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **real-time EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) that decodes individual finger movements using deep learning, enabling dexterous, finger-level control of a robotic hand**[5][6]. The key innovation is the demonstration that noninvasive EEG signals can be reliably and rapidly translated into fine-grained, multi-finger robotic actions, overcoming previous limitations of noninvasive BCIs that could only achieve coarse or grouped finger control[5][6]. This advance holds significant potential for biorobotics, as it paves the way for more naturalistic, high-DOF prosthetic and assistive devices controlled directly by users’ brain activity, expanding the capabilities and accessibility of neurotechnology for rehabilitation and human-robot interaction[5][6].

### Soft robotics and functional electrical stimulation advances for hand rehabilitation

**Authors:** Yanan Sun; Yuxiang Sun; Zhiqiang Wei; Xinyu Zhang

**DOI:** 10.3390/bioengineering9040147

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** soft robotics, functional electrical stimulation, hand rehabilitation, wearable devices[6]

**Summary:** The paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates **soft robotics** with **functional electrical stimulation (FES)** to advance hand rehabilitation, focusing on wearable devices that provide adaptive, safe, and personalized assistance for patients with impaired hand function[6][4]. This combined methodology leverages the compliance and comfort of soft robotic actuators with the neuromuscular activation offered by FES, potentially enabling more effective, task-specific rehabilitation and expanding the capabilities of biorobotics for neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies[4][5]. The synergy of these technologies represents a significant step toward intelligent, user-friendly rehabilitation systems that can be deployed in clinical and home settings, with broad implications for future biorobotics research and application[6][4].
