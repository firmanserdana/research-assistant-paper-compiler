**Summary:** The paper introduces a **real-time EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) that decodes individual finger movements using deep learning, enabling dexterous, finger-level control of a robotic hand**[5][6]. The key innovation is the demonstration that noninvasive EEG signals can be reliably and rapidly translated into fine-grained, multi-finger robotic actions, overcoming previous limitations of noninvasive BCIs that could only achieve coarse or grouped finger control[5][6]. This advance holds significant potential for biorobotics, as it paves the way for more naturalistic, high-DOF prosthetic and assistive devices controlled directly by users’ brain activity, expanding the capabilities and accessibility of neurotechnology for rehabilitation and human-robot interaction[5][6]. ---
