### Sensing and Decoding the Neural Drive to Paralyzed Muscles During Volitional Attempt After Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** Francesco Negro; Dario Farina; Silvia Muceli; Alessandro Del Vecchio; Marco Gazzoni; Roberto Merletti

**DOI:** 10.1126/sciadv.abj2897

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** surface EMG, motor unit decomposition, neural drive, spinal cord injury, wearable sensors, motor control[5]

**Summary:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a wearable surface EMG sensor array to detect and decode residual motor unit activity in muscles below the level of cervical spinal cord injury, enabling prediction of attempted finger and hand movements despite clinical paralysis.[2] The key innovation lies in applying motor unit decomposition techniques to extract volitional motor commands from subclinical myoelectric signals in discomplete spinal cord injuries, revealing that the corticospinal tract retains partial integrity.[2] For biorobotics research, this approach establishes a practical, non-invasive interface for decoding motor intent that could enable real-time control of assistive devices and prosthetics to restore multidegree-of-freedom hand function in paralyzed individuals.[2]

### Neurorehabilitation Through Synergistic Man-Machine Interfaces: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial in Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** Marco Godi; Matteo Bianchi; Silvia Salatino; Andrea Mannini; Andrea d’Avella; Maria Chiara Carrozza

**DOI:** 10.2196/41152

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** man-machine interface, EMG decoding, spinal cord injury, neurorehabilitation, wearable robotics[6]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this study is the development and clinical testing of a **synergistic neurorehabilitation protocol** for spinal cord injury using multiple immersive **man-machine interfaces**—including EMG-decoding wearable robotics, brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled robotic arms, and augmented reality modules—to promote dormant neuroplasticity and optimize motor recovery[1][5]. By integrating rich multimodal feedback (visual, tactile, and kinesthetic) and serious gaming, the protocol aims to retrain central nervous system circuits and enhance motivation, with potential impact for biorobotics research in designing individualized assistive technologies and advancing understanding of neuroplasticity mechanisms in SCI rehabilitation[1][5][6].

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (1 papers)

### **Convolutional neural networks decode finger movements in motor cortex using non-invasive MEG**

**Authors:** Matteo Borra; Andrea Gualandi; Marco Marino; Silvia Gazzola; Matteo Feurra; Giovanni Mirabella; Vincenzo Romei

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnins.2024.12454436

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** finger movement decoding, MEG, convolutional neural networks, motor learning

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is the validation of a compact **convolutional neural network (LF-CNN)** for fast and reliable decoding of individual finger movements from non-invasive **magnetoencephalographic (MEG)** recordings, achieving 80–85% accuracy for single-finger discrimination and over 95% for hand laterality[1][3][4]. LF-CNN offers significant advantages in computational efficiency and interpretability over more complex deep learning architectures, enabling direct examination of neurophysiological patterns in the motor cortex[1][3][4]. This approach holds substantial promise for **biorobotics**, as it enables high-resolution, interpretable decoding of fine motor actions from non-invasive signals, facilitating advanced brain–computer interfaces for robotic control and neuroprosthetics[1][3][4].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### Soft robotics and functional electrical stimulation advances for hand function recovery in spinal cord injury

**Authors:** Cristina Paredes-Marchán; Francisco J. Rodríguez; José L. Pons

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.rehab.2022.101653

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** Functional electrical stimulation, soft robotics, hand rehabilitation, neuroprosthesis, spinal cord injury[4]

**Summary:** The paper reviews recent advances in **soft robotics (SR) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) wearable devices** for hand function recovery in spinal cord injury, highlighting their technical features and functional outcomes[1][2]. The key innovation is the identification of complementary roles for SR and FES—SR offers adaptable, comfortable, and portable assistance, while FES enhances neuroplasticity—suggesting that hybrid systems could maximize rehabilitation efficacy and user independence[2]. This synthesis provides a roadmap for biorobotics research, emphasizing the need for improved user intent detection, portability, and standardized outcome measures to facilitate clinical translation[1][2].

### Fine-tuned brain-computer interface makes prosthetic limbs feel real

**Authors:** Sliman Bensmaia; Matthew Fifer; Emily Graczyk; Lee E. Miller

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.neuron.2024.01.012

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** Intracortical microstimulation, tactile feedback, prosthetic hand, brain-computer interface, sensory mapping[7]

**Summary:** The key innovation of this paper is a **fine-tuned brain-computer interface (BCI) that delivers realistic tactile feedback to prosthetic hands via intracortical microstimulation**, enabling users to perceive nuanced sensations such as the shape, movement, and boundaries of objects through their bionic limbs[1][2][4]. By orchestrating patterns of stimulation across overlapping sensory zones in the brain, the system allows users to experience continuous, lifelike touch and significantly improves their ability to manipulate and respond to complex tactile stimuli[2][4].

This approach advances biorobotics by moving prosthetic feedback closer to the adaptive abilities of natural touch, paving the way for prosthetic devices that restore both movement and sensation, and enhancing independence and quality of life for individuals with limb loss[1][2][4].
