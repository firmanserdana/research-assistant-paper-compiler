## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### Concurrent Decoding of Finger Kinematic and Kinetic Variables based on Motor Unit Discharges

**Authors:** Rinku Roy; Derek G. Kamper; Xiaogang Hu

**DOI:** 10.1109/ICHMS56717.2022.9980636

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** finger kinematics, kinetic decoding, motor unit discharge, neural interface, regression

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **neural decoding approach that enables the concurrent prediction of both finger kinematic (movement) and kinetic (force) variables from motor unit discharge patterns**[2][3][4]. The key innovation lies in leveraging motor unit activity to simultaneously decode multiple aspects of finger function, which could significantly enhance the control of neural interfaces for biorobotics and prosthetic devices by enabling more natural and precise hand movements[3][4]. This advancement holds potential to improve dexterous manipulation in robotic hands and next-generation prosthetic systems by providing richer, multi-dimensional control signals derived directly from neural activity[3][4].

### State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble and LFP activity during dexterous reach-to-grasp movements

**Authors:** V. Aggarwal; M. H. Schieber; N. V. Thakor

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00995.2011

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** hand kinematics, finger kinematics, intracortical ensemble, local field potential, reach-to-grasp, neural decoding

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **state-based decoding framework** that combines local field potential (LFP)-based state detection with spike-based kinematic decoding to improve the continuous decoding of hand and finger kinematics during dexterous reach-to-grasp movements[2][5]. The key innovation is using LFP activity to autonomously identify behavioral states (e.g., movement vs. posture) and trigger precise spike-based decoding of complex, multi-joint hand kinematics, resulting in significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to conventional methods[2]. This approach has substantial potential impact for **biorobotics and neuroprosthetics**, as it advances the autonomous, real-time control of multifingered robotic hands or prostheses by leveraging distinct neural signals for state detection and movement execution[2].

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (3 papers)

### Biomimetic sensory feedback through peripheral nerve stimulation improves dexterous use of a bionic hand

**Authors:** Silvestro Micera; Christian Cipriani; Francesco M. Petrini; Stanisa Raspopovic; Giacomo Valle; Edoardo D’Anna

**DOI:** 10.1126/scirobotics.aau9924

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** biomimetic sensory feedback, peripheral nerve stimulation, bionic hand, dexterous control, neuroengineering

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **biomimetic sensory feedback delivered via peripheral nerve stimulation enables more dexterous and intuitive control of a bionic hand**[2][1]. The key innovation is a closed-loop system where naturalistic sensory signals, mimicking the temporal and spatial patterns of real touch, are encoded and delivered to the user’s nerves, significantly improving grip precision, object discrimination, and manipulation of fragile items compared to non-biomimetic feedback[2][1]. This approach marks a major advance for biorobotics by showing that replicating the nervous system’s natural language in artificial limbs can restore both functional and perceptual aspects of touch, paving the way for more lifelike and effective prosthetic devices[2][1].

### Selectivity and Longevity of Peripheral-Nerve and Machine Interfaces: A Review

**Authors:** Zachary T. Irwin; Cynthia A. Chestek

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnbot.2017.00059

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** peripheral nerve interface, selectivity, longevity, neural prosthetics, machine interface

**Summary:** The paper reviews the **challenges and advancements in peripheral nerve interfaces (PNIs)** for neural prosthetics, emphasizing the need for both **high selectivity** (precise targeting of specific nerve fibers) and **long-term stability** (interface longevity) to achieve effective, naturalistic bidirectional nerve-machine communication[2][8][10]. The key innovation discussed is a **hybrid interface approach** that combines the strengths of existing PNI designs to enhance both selectivity and durability, which is critical for reliable sensory feedback and intuitive control in biorobotics applications[2][8]. This work has significant potential impact for biorobotics research by guiding the development of next-generation neuroprosthetic devices capable of more natural and robust human-machine integration[2][8].

### Soft robotics and functional electrical stimulation advances for restoring hand function in people with SCI: a narrative review, clinical guidelines and future directions

**Authors:** S. J. Grahn; M. A. C. van der Sluis; J. L. H. Evers; J. L. van der Kooij; J. H. van der Meulen; J. H. van der Meulen

**DOI:** 10.1007/s00415-023-11939-2

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** soft robotics, functional electrical stimulation, spinal cord injury, hand function, rehabilitation robotics

**Summary:** The paper reviews recent advances in **soft robotics (SR)** and **functional electrical stimulation (FES)** for restoring hand function in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI), highlighting the integration of wearable SR and FES devices as a key innovation for both assistive and therapeutic applications[1][3][4][6]. The authors identify that while these technologies show strong potential for improving functional outcomes, major challenges remain in user intent detection, device portability, and standardized outcome assessment, which currently limit widespread clinical adoption; addressing these will significantly impact the field of **biorobotics** by advancing home-based, user-adaptive rehabilitation solutions[1][6].
