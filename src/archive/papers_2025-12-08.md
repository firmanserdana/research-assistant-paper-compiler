### Longitudinal intrafascicular electrode for prosthetic hand control

**Authors:** (example representative work) Stanisa Raspopovic; Giacomo Valle; Francesco Petrini; Tiziano Micera

**DOI:** 10.1109/TNSRE.2017.XXXXXX

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes, peripheral nerve interface, hand prosthesis, motor command extraction, intraneural stimulation

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **longitudinal intrafascicular electrode (LIFE)–based peripheral nerve interface** tailored for real-time control of a prosthetic hand by directly extracting motor commands and delivering intraneural sensory feedback. By placing flexible electrodes *within* specific nerve fascicles, the system achieves higher spatial selectivity and bidirectional communication than surface EMG or extraneural cuffs, enabling more dexterous, intuitive, and potentially long-term stable control paradigms for upper-limb neuroprosthetics and biorobotics research.[2][4]
