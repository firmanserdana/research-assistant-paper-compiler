**Summary:** This study demonstrates that **multi-electrode intracortical microstimulation (ICMS)** in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of tetraplegic humans evokes stable, somatotopically matched perceptual fields (PFs) with controllable size, shape, and intensity via amplitude and frequency modulation, where overlapping PFs summate to produce more focal, localizable, and gradated sensations mimicking natural touch.[1] A key innovation is the precise mapping of bionic hand force sensors to corresponding S1 electrodes, enabling amplitude-modulated ICMS to convey object contact force and location with improved dynamic range and discriminability over single-electrode stimulation.[1] For **biorobotics research**, this advances brain-computer interfaces by restoring intuitive tactile feedback for prosthetic control, potentially enhancing grip precision and object manipulation in real-world tasks despite limitations in high-force dynamic range.[1] ---
