### Evoking stable and precise tactile sensations via multi-electrode intracortical microstimulation in human somatosensory cortex

**Authors:** Christopher L. Hughes; Matthew S. Fifer; David M. Rose; Tessy M. Thomas; Nathan E. Crone; Brock A. Wester; others[2]

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41551-024-01299-z

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **Intracortical microstimulation**, Tactile feedback, Robotic hand, Brain–computer interface, Multi-electrode stimulation, Somatosensory cortex

**Summary:** This study demonstrates that **multi-electrode intracortical microstimulation (ICMS)** in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of tetraplegic humans evokes stable, somatotopically matched perceptual fields (PFs) with controllable size, shape, and intensity via amplitude and frequency modulation, where overlapping PFs summate to produce more focal, localizable, and gradated sensations mimicking natural touch.[1] A key innovation is the precise mapping of bionic hand force sensors to corresponding S1 electrodes, enabling amplitude-modulated ICMS to convey object contact force and location with improved dynamic range and discriminability over single-electrode stimulation.[1] For **biorobotics research**, this advances brain-computer interfaces by restoring intuitive tactile feedback for prosthetic control, potentially enhancing grip precision and object manipulation in real-world tasks despite limitations in high-force dynamic range.[1]

### AI-driven hybrid rehabilitation: synergizing robotics and electrical neuromuscular stimulation for upper-limb motor recovery

**Authors:** Ahmed Bouteraa; Mohamed Wassim Moghbel; Zaineb Karray; others[6]

**DOI:** 10.3389/fbioe.2025.1619247

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **Neuromuscular electrical stimulation**, EMG-driven control, Robotic rehabilitation, Upper-limb motor function, Adaptive stimulation, Hand movement

**Summary:** This paper introduces an **AI-enhanced hybrid rehabilitation system** integrating a dual-arm robotic platform with **EMG-guided neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)**, featuring a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model for real-time muscle fatigue detection via EMG time-frequency features, enabling adaptive stimulation adjustments in a ROS2-based closed-loop architecture for bilateral upper-limb therapy in stroke survivors.[1][2] The key innovation lies in its fatigue-aware, personalized control that synergizes robotic assistance with NMES to promote voluntary motor relearning, outperforming traditional open-loop systems, with preliminary trials in three patients showing **44% increased range of motion**, **45% enhanced active torque**, and **95% SVM accuracy**.[1][2] For **biorobotics research**, it advances intelligent hybrid paradigms by demonstrating measurable neuroplasticity gains and scalability potential through clinician-supervised remote adaptation.[2]
