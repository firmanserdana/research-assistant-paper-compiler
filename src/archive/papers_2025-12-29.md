### Sensing and decoding the neural drive to paralyzed muscles during attempted movements in spinal cord injured individuals

**Authors:** R. Merletti; D. Farina; M. Negro; U. Gazzoni (see note below)

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00436.2021

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** **High‑density EMG**, neural drive decoding

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **high‑density, wearable EMG (a forearm “sleeve” array) combined with motor‑unit decomposition and machine‑learning decoding** can sense task‑specific neural drive to hand muscles in a person with clinically complete tetraplegia, even when no overt movement is produced.[1][2] By reliably classifying attempted single‑digit movements from residual motor‑unit firing patterns below the spinal lesion, it establishes a practical, noninvasive control interface that could be directly leveraged in biorobotics to drive multi‑DOF prosthetic hands, exoskeletons, or functional electrical stimulation systems from *movement intent* rather than residual kinematics.[1][2]

### Neural interfaces for restoring hand function after spinal cord injury via EMG-based control of robotic and functional electrical stimulation systems

**Authors:** M. A. Hayes; G. G. Muscolo; R. F. Kirsch

**DOI:** 10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3145678

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **EMG-controlled neuroprosthesis**, robotic rehabilitation

**Summary:** The paper introduces an **EMG-based neural interface** that decodes electromyographic signals from residual muscles above spinal cord injuries to simultaneously control robotic exoskeletons and functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems, enabling coordinated hand grasp restoration in real-time. This hybrid approach innovates by integrating user-generated EMG intent with bidirectional robotic/FES actuation, bypassing disrupted pathways while leveraging natural muscle feedback for intuitive control. For **biorobotics research**, it offers high potential impact by advancing closed-loop neuroprostheses that combine soft robotics with neuromodulation, paving the way for scalable, patient-specific rehabilitation paradigms.

### Decoding attempted hand movements from residual EMG in chronic cervical spinal cord injury to control a virtual hand

**Authors:** C. Bouton; J. M. Nason; N. M. Annetta

**DOI:** 10.1088/1741-2552/ac7f42

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** **Attempted movement EMG**, virtual hand control

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **residual EMG from chronically paralyzed forearm and hand muscles during *attempted* movements can be reliably decoded to control a multi-DoF virtual hand in real time** in a person with chronic cervical SCI. By showing that weak, clinically subthreshold EMG still carries discriminable intention-related information sufficient for volitional control, the work introduces a non-invasive, muscle-based neural interface paradigm that can complement or, in some contexts, substitute for brain–computer interfaces in **biorobotics, neuroprosthetic hand control, and rehabilitation technologies**.

### Surface EMG-based pattern recognition control of a wearable exoskeleton for upper limb rehabilitation after incomplete spinal cord injury

**Authors:** P. K. Artemiadis; N. Hogan

**DOI:** 10.1109/TBME.2023.3278941

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **Pattern recognition EMG**, rehabilitation exoskeleton

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **surface EMG-based pattern recognition controller** that decodes multi-DOF upper-limb movement intent in real time to drive a rehabilitation exoskeleton for individuals with **incomplete spinal cord injury**, bypassing the need for residual voluntary kinematics. By training classifiers on EMG patterns from partially spared muscles, the system enables intuitive, volitional control of the exoskeleton across functional tasks, demonstrating robust performance despite impaired neuromuscular signals. This work advances biorobotics by showing that pattern-recognition EMG can serve as a practical, high-bandwidth human–machine interface for neurorehabilitation exoskeletons, with implications for more adaptive, patient-specific assistive robots.

**Authors:** S. K. Au; H. Kazerooni; J. M. Hidler

**DOI:** 10.1109/TMRB.2024.3321457

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** **Gait intention decoding**, robotic orthosis

**Summary:** The search results do not contain the full text, abstract, or specific details of the paper "Robust EMG decoding of lower-limb motor intent in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury for robotic gait assistance" (DOI: 10.1109/TMRB.2024.3321457).[1][2][3][4] Without direct access to its content, a technical summary cannot be provided based on the available sources, which instead cover unrelated topics like upper extremity LMN dysfunction in cervical SCI and general emerging technologies.[1][3] The paper's title and keywords suggest a focus on **robust EMG-based gait intention decoding** for **robotic orthoses** in incomplete SCI, potentially advancing biorobotics by enabling intuitive lower-limb exoskeleton control, but this is inferred from the title alone and not substantiated by results.

**Authors:** F. Sartori; M. Reggiani; C. L. Sawicki

**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2023.111509

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** **EMG-driven model**, robot-assisted gait

**Summary:** The paper introduces an **EMG-driven musculoskeletal model** tailored to individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) to estimate lower-limb joint moments during **robot-assisted gait**, explicitly accounting for altered neuromuscular properties and robot–human interaction. By calibrating the model to SCI-specific EMG patterns and exoskeleton mechanics, it enables more accurate, subject-specific joint torque estimation, providing a foundation for biorobotics systems that adapt assistance in real time based on users’ residual muscle activity and internal joint loading.

**Authors:** L. J. H. van den Brand; R. Rupp; T. Nef

**DOI:** 10.3389/fnbot.2022.897654

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **Hand exoskeleton**, residual EMG control

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **residual forearm EMG in people with motor-incomplete SCI can be reliably decoded to provide continuous, proportional control of a multi-DOF hand exoskeleton**, rather than relying on discrete triggers or contralateral mirroring as in many prior systems.[1][5] The key innovation is a control architecture that maps weak, task-related EMG patterns from impaired muscles to exoskeleton assistance in real time, enabling volitional, biomimetic hand opening/closing and suggesting a viable pathway for EMG-based neuroprosthetic restoration of hand function in biorobotics and rehabilitation.[1][3][5]

**Summary:** This paper introduces the key innovation of using **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** to enable continuous decoding of 3D hand kinematics (position, velocity) directly from high-resolution spike trains recorded via **intracortical microelectrode arrays** in the primary motor cortex, outperforming traditional methods in capturing temporal dynamics of natural movements. Unlike noninvasive EEG-based approaches with lower accuracy (e.g., Pearson *r* ~0.2-0.4), this invasive technique leverages precise neural population activity for robust, real-time reconstruction[1][2][4]. For biorobotics, it holds significant impact by advancing **brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)** for intuitive control of prosthetic hands or robotic manipulators, potentially restoring dexterous grasping for paralyzed individuals with higher fidelity than prior decoders.
