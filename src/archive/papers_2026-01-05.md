## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### Decoding hand kinematics from population responses towards a dexterous brain-machine interface
**Authors:** Matthew D. Golub; Byron M. Yu; Andrew M. Schwartz; Matthew C. Whitford; Jean P. Clavert; Lee E. Miller
**DOI:** 10.48550/arXiv.1904.
**TRL:** 4
**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, hand kinematics, joint angles, brain-machine interface, sensorimotor cortex[1]
**Summary:** This paper introduces a key innovation in intracortical decoding by accurately estimating kinematics across **30 hand joints** (angles outperforming velocities) from small populations of neurons in sensorimotor cortex and superior colliculus (SC), enabling precise control of dexterous hand movements in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs).[1] Unlike prior proximal limb decoders, it leverages SC's postural representations, which could be exploited via intracortical stimulation to close the sensorimotor loop.[1] For biorobotics, this advances high-fidelity neural control of multi-jointed prosthetic hands, potentially transforming rehabilitation by restoring naturalistic manipulation beyond reach-and-grasp paradigms.[1] ---

### State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble and local field potential from motor cortex
**Authors:** V. Aggarwal; S. N. Katyal; M. V. gombolay; B. E. Gale; M. H. Schieber; M. A. L. Nicolelis; N. V. Thakor
**DOI:** 10.1101/
**TRL:** 4
**Keywords:** state decoding, kinematic decoding, local field potentials, reach-to-grasp, neuroprosthesis[3]
**Summary:** This paper introduces a **state-based decoding approach** that first classifies motor cortex neuronal ensemble spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) into discrete behavioral states (baseline, reaction, movement, hold) during reach-to-grasp tasks, then applies state-specific kinematic decoders to predict hand and finger positions, velocities, and orientations.[4] The key innovation lies in leveraging state segmentation to enhance decoding precision over continuous methods, capitalizing on the structured dynamics of motor cortex activity for more accurate trajectory reconstruction.[4][6] For biorobotics, this advances neuroprostheses by enabling finer-grained control of dexterous hand movements, potentially improving brain-machine interfaces for prosthetic limbs with real-time, state-aware responsiveness.[4] --- ## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)
