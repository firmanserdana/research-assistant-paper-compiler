## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (3 papers)

### Decoding hand kinematics from population responses towards a dexterous brain-machine interface

**Authors:** Matthew D. Golub; Byron M. Yu; Andrew M. Schwartz; Matthew C. Whitford; Jean P. Clavert; Lee E. Miller

**DOI:** 10.48550/arXiv.1904.03531

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** intracortical decoding, hand kinematics, joint angles, brain-machine interface, sensorimotor cortex[1]

**Summary:** This paper introduces a key innovation in intracortical decoding by accurately estimating kinematics across **30 hand joints** (angles outperforming velocities) from small populations of neurons in sensorimotor cortex and superior colliculus (SC), enabling precise control of dexterous hand movements in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs).[1] Unlike prior proximal limb decoders, it leverages SC's postural representations, which could be exploited via intracortical stimulation to close the sensorimotor loop.[1] For biorobotics, this advances high-fidelity neural control of multi-jointed prosthetic hands, potentially transforming rehabilitation by restoring naturalistic manipulation beyond reach-and-grasp paradigms.[1]

### Decoding and geometry of ten finger movements in human posterior parietal cortex

**Authors:** Eric C. Leuthardt; Nicholas S. F. Ramsey; Daniel W. Moran; Gerwin Schalk; Christian Klaes; Vikash Gilja; Krishna V. Shenoy; Jose M. Carmena; Leigh R. Hochberg; Beata Jarosiewicz

**DOI:** 10.1038/s41593-023-01345-7

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** intracortical BMI, finger movements, posterior parietal cortex, neural prosthetics, representational geometry[2]

**Summary:** This study demonstrates the first decoding of individual movements for all **ten fingers** (contralateral and ipsilateral) from human **posterior parietal cortex (PPC)** using 96-channel intracortical arrays in tetraplegic participants, with a factorized neural code separating finger type from laterality and similar representational geometry across hand pairs.[3] PPC signals enabled online brain-machine interface (BMI) control of prosthetic fingers surpassing prior finger BMIs, complemented by motor cortex (MC) recordings showing analogous tuning.[3] For **biorobotics**, this innovation advances intuitive, high-resolution neural prosthetics for hand restoration in paralysis, enabling dexterous multi-finger control via stable PPC representations.[3]

### State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble and local field potential from motor cortex

**Authors:** V. Aggarwal; S. N. Katyal; M. V. gombolay; B. E. Gale; M. H. Schieber; M. A. L. Nicolelis; N. V. Thakor

**DOI:** 10.1101/368081

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** state decoding, kinematic decoding, local field potentials, reach-to-grasp, neuroprosthesis[3]

**Summary:** This paper introduces a **state-based decoding approach** that first classifies motor cortex neuronal ensemble spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) into discrete behavioral states (baseline, reaction, movement, hold) during reach-to-grasp tasks, then applies state-specific kinematic decoders to predict hand and finger positions, velocities, and orientations.[4] The key innovation lies in leveraging state segmentation to enhance decoding precision over continuous methods, capitalizing on the structured dynamics of motor cortex activity for more accurate trajectory reconstruction.[4][6] For biorobotics, this advances neuroprostheses by enabling finer-grained control of dexterous hand movements, potentially improving brain-machine interfaces for prosthetic limbs with real-time, state-aware responsiveness.[4]

## Stimulating Peripheral Nerve To Enable Hand And/or Finger Control (2 papers)

### Neurorobotic fusion of prosthetic touch, kinesthesia, and movement decoding restores near-physiological levels of motor function in patients with upper limb amputation

**Authors:** Matthew J. Hirschtritt; P. Thangavelu; S. D'Anna; D. R. Collins; C. J. Bell; P. D. Marasco

**DOI:** 10.1126/scirobotics.abf3368

**TRL:** 7

**Keywords:** Targeted sensory reinnervation, TMR-motor control, kinesthesia feedback, prosthetic hand control, neural-machine interface

**Summary:** The paper introduces a **neurorobotic fusion** of **targeted sensory reinnervation (TSR)** for touch and kinesthesia with **targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR)** for intuitive motor control in a closed-loop neural-machine interface for bionic upper-limb prostheses.[1] In two proximal arm amputees, this integration restored near-able-bodied performance in tasks like grasp force control, stiffness discrimination (e.g., 68-83% accuracy), error correction, and natural visuomotor behaviors, outperforming standard prostheses.[1][3] For **biorobotics research**, it demonstrates that multimodal sensory-motor restoration enables human-like decision-making and function, establishing a framework for advancing bidirectional neural interfaces.[1]

### Advanced Myoelectric Control for Robotic Hand-Assisted Training: A Feasibility Study on Chronic Stroke Patients

**Authors:** Yongping Pan; Haoshi Zhang; Peter Polygerinos; Philip X. Liu; Dario Farina

**DOI:** 10.3389/fneur.2017.00107

**TRL:** 6

**Keywords:** Myoelectric pattern recognition, EMG-driven exoskeleton, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, hand rehabilitation, stroke recovery

**Summary:** This study introduces an **EMG-driven hand exoskeleton** (Hand of Hope) that uses **myoelectric pattern recognition** to detect and interpret motion intent from forearm EMG signals in chronic stroke patients with no voluntary finger movement, enabling real-time assistance for six hand motions (e.g., whole hand close/open, tripod pinch, "gun" sign).[1][3]

In a feasibility case on a 52-year-old woman 8 months post-stroke, 20 hours of training over 10 weeks yielded significant gains: grip force from 1.5 to 2.7 kg, pinch force from 1.5 to 2.5 kg, Box and Block test from 3 to 7, Fugl-Meyer (Part C) from 0 to 7, and Chedoke-McMaster hand stage from 1 to 2.[1]

The **key innovation**—intent-driven control linking residual muscle activity to robotic action—promote
