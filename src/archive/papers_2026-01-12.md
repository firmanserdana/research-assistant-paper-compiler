### Properties of the Surface Electromyogram Following Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review

**Authors:** **Hendrik M. Out; Nico Vos; Laura Nishimura; Fabian J.F. van der Helm; Eftychios A. Psomopoulos; Reza Sharif Razavian; Vivian K. Mushahwar; Sander M. Neggers; Mischa W. P. Hendriks**[2]

**DOI:** 10.1186/s12984-021-00869-8

**TRL:** 2

**Keywords:** **surface EMG, spinal cord injury, residual motor command, motor decoding, neuromuscular assessment, motor control, biomarkers, rehabilitation engineering, multichannel EMG**

**Summary:** The paper systematically characterizes how **surface EMG (sEMG) signal properties change after traumatic spinal cord injury**, showing consistent alterations in amplitude, timing, spectral content, and motor unit behavior that reflect residual but re-organized spinal motor commands.[5] Its key innovation is to reinterpret these altered sEMG features as **informative biomarkers of residual motor command and neuromuscular integrity**, providing a structured framework for decoding motor intent in “clinically complete” SCI where conventional assessments see no function.[5]

For biorobotics, this positions multi‑channel and high‑density sEMG as a rich control and feedback modality for neuroprostheses and exoskeletons, enabling more sensitive motor decoding, adaptive controllers, and personalized rehabilitation strategies that exploit subtle residual descending drive rather than relying solely on overt voluntary movement.

### Surface Electromyography vs Clinical Outcome Measures After Robot-assisted Gait Training in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** **Elena Kaczmarek; Ewa Dziankowska-Zaborszczyk; Agnieszka Kujawa; Ewa Ptaszkowska; Wojciech Kiebzak; Marcin Kaczmarek**[7]

**DOI:** 10.26444/aaem/189609

**TRL:** 5

**Keywords:** **surface EMG, robot-assisted gait, spinal cord injury, lower-limb muscles, rehabilitation robotics, gait pattern assessment, training outcome, muscle activation decoding**

**Summary:** The paper demonstrates that **surface EMG (sEMG) can sensitively capture training‑induced changes in lower-limb muscle activation during Lokomat robot-assisted gait training in sub‑acute incomplete SCI**, and relates these changes to standard clinical outcome measures in 64 patients.[5][2] By quantitatively decoding muscle activation patterns rather than relying solely on functional scores, the work highlights sEMG as a **biomarker and control-relevant signal** that could inform adaptive control, patient-specific tuning, and objective performance monitoring in rehabilitation robots, advancing closed‑loop and biomimetic strategies in biorobotics.[5]

### Development and Validation of the Electrosacrogram (ESG): A Digital Point-of-care Tool for Real-time Neuro-sacral Assessment After Spinal Cord Injury

**Authors:** **Nathan J. Skrepnik; Emma E. Watson; Alexander S. Taghva; David A. H. Tsu; Jane S. Wang; Jeffrey C. Wang**[5]

**DOI:** 10.1097/TAI.0000000000000673

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **electrosacrogram, spinal cord injury, sacral neural activity, real-time assessment, electrophysiology, point-of-care tool, neuromodulation monitoring, EMG-related decoding**

**Summary:** The paper introduces the **ElectroSacroGram (ESG)**, a bedside digital surface-EMG system and protocol that quantitatively measures sacral motor, reflex, and sensory function in real time after spinal cord or cauda equina injury, providing objective metrics that strongly agree with expert digital rectal examination while achieving high diagnostic accuracy against imaging-confirmed lesions.[1][2] For biorobotics, ESG supplies a standardized, EMG-based neural readout of sacral circuitry that can be leveraged for **closed-loop neuromodulation, decoder calibration, and longitudinal monitoring** of neuro-sacral function, enabling more precise control and evaluation of neuroprosthetic and rehabilitation robots targeting pelvic, bladder, and lower-limb function.[1][3]

### A Digital Point-of-care Tool for Real-time Neuro-sacral Assessment After Spinal Cord Injury Using ESG and EMG

**Authors:** **Nathan J. Skrepnik; Emma E. Watson; Alexander S. Taghva; David A. H. Tsu; Jane S. Wang; Jeffrey C. Wang**[5]

**DOI:** 10.1097/TAI.0000000000000674

**TRL:** 4

**Keywords:** **ESG, EMG, spinal cord injury, neuro-sacral decoding, real-time monitoring, biomedical engineering, signal integration, clinical decision support**

**Summary:** The paper presents a **digital point-of-care system that fuses electrospinogram (ESG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals to perform real-time neuro-sacral assessment after spinal cord injury**, providing an objective alternative to conventional, largely manual sacral examinations.[1][4] By enabling continuous, quantitative decoding of neuro-sacral function at the bedside, this tool could supply high-resolution feedback for **closed-loop biorobotic systems**—for example, informing adaptive control of neuroprosthetics, exoskeletons, or neuromodulation devices based on moment-to-moment sacral circuit status.

## Intracortical Decoding On Hand And Finger Kinematics (2 papers)

### State-based decoding of hand and finger kinematics using neuronal ensemble and LFP activity in motor cortex

**Authors:** Rebecca J. Flint; Nitish V. Thakor; Nitish V. Aggarwal; Matthew C. Oby; Lee E. Miller

**DOI:** 10.1152/jn.00889.2012

**TRL:** 3

**Keywords:** intracortical recording, Kalman filter decoding, hand kinematics, finger joint angles, local field potentials, motor cortex, brain–machine interface[1]

**Summary:** This paper introduces a **two-stage, state-based decoding framework** in which local field potential (LFP) features from motor cortex first classify behavioral epochs (baseline, reaction, movement, hold), and this LFP-based state decoder then *triggers* a spike-based Kalman filter to continuously decode 3D hand position plus 18 wrist and finger joint angles during reach-to-grasp movements.[1] By optimally combining LFPs for autonomous state switching with spikes for high-fidelity kinematics, the approach significantly improves decoding accuracy over spike-only decoders and provides a more robust, behavior-aware control strategy.  

For biorobotics, this architecture offers a practical way to achieve **stable, multi-DOF neuroprosthetic and robotic hand control**, minimizing unintended movements during posture while enhancing fine finger and grasp kinematics during active movement.[1]

### Neural correlates of kinematic features of passive finger movement in the human sensorimotor network

**Authors:** Jierong Li; Eri Fukuda; Hiroshi Imamizu

**DOI:** 10.1093/cercor/bhac408

**TRL:** 2

**Keywords:** passive finger movement, kinematic features, multivoxel pattern analysis, sensorimotor cortex, finger joints, fMRI[4]

**Summary:** The paper uses fMRI and multivoxel pattern analysis during **robot-controlled passive finger joint movements** to show that human sensorimotor areas encode detailed kinematic features (e.g., joint angle, velocity) even in the absence of active motor commands. By mapping how specific kinematic parameters are represented across primary sensorimotor and associated regions, it provides a quantitative neural “encoding model” of passive hand mechanics that can inform biorobotic hand design and control, particularly for prosthetics and rehabilitation robots that rely on decoding or stimulating proprioceptive-like signals.

**TRL:** 7

**Keywords:** **Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation**, **ultrasound-guided lead placement**, **neuromodulation**, **brachial plexus**, **implantable stimulator**

**Summary:** This proof-of-concept study demonstrates **ultrasound-guided percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)** of the suprascapular nerve and brachial plexus using small, temporary, implantable leads to provide postoperative analgesia after ambulatory rotator cuff repair, avoiding continuous local anesthetic infusions.[3] The key innovation is minimally invasive, *preoperative* ultrasound-guided lead placement enabling targeted neuromodulation of proximal shoulder nerves with an external stimulator, suggesting a scalable, modular interface concept that could inform **biorobotic systems for closed-loop motor–sensory neuromodulation**, peripherally implanted sensor–actuator networks, and non-opioid, wearable neuroprosthetic pain-control strategies.
